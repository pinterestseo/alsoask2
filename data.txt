<h2>We all wish our dogs were a little more obedient and could do a few more entertaining tricks.&nbsp;Did you watch&nbsp;<a href="https://crufts.org.uk/" title="Crufts dog show link" target="_blank">Crufts</a> and have dreams of entering your pooch?&nbsp;<strong>Dr Emma Scales-Theobald, PhD (dog behaviourist)</strong> has shared her top tips for training your pooch some new Crufts-worthy agility tricks from the comfort of your own garden.</h2>
      <p>Whilst your dog might not be quite Crufts ready, agility tricks are not only great for their health, but they are a great mental stimulant and will keep your pup both happy and healthy.</p>
      <h2 id="What age can puppies start agility training?">What age can puppies start agility training?</h2>
      <p>If you want a dog that has a long repertoire of impressive tricks, like any other training, it's best to start them young! But when's the best time to start?</p>
      <p>Agility training will be too strenuous for young puppies, (8-16 weeks) and they'll either be too young to understand such complex training or too tuckered out to continue.</p>
      <h2><strong>The best age to start agility training your dog is 12 months and over</strong>. This way, they're still young enough to soak up all the new tricks like a sponge and old enough to keep up with the training. Plus,&nbsp;<a href="https://crufts.org.uk/dog-exhibitors/agility/qualification-for-crufts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dogs can't compete in agility competitions until they're 18 months and over</a> (if you&nbsp;want to go as far as competing!)</h2>
      <p>That said, regular puppy training like obedience, sleep, toilet and leash training can start from the get-go! This will also get them accustomed to a training routine, and to the fact that when they do what they're told, they get a tasty treat.</p>
      <h2 id="Things to know before your training">Things to know before your training</h2>
      <p>Dr Emma says “Before jumping straight into training, there are a few things you, as the owner, need to check and make sure you have in order for your training to run smoothly and for both you and your dog to get the most out of it.”</p>
      <h3 id="Patience">Patience</h3>
      <p>Training isn’t always easy, and it is often very repetitive, so patience is crucial.</p>
      <p>As much as we wish we could, we can’t communicate with our dogs, so they aren’t going to understand or pick things up straight away, which of course, can be frustrating.</p>
      <p>But like you, they are doing their best. Maintaining a level of patience throughout training will make it a more positive experience for both you and your dog.</p>
      <h3 id="Tasty treats">Tasty treats</h3>
      <p>Unfortunately, most dogs won't perform without some kind of incentive, so you’re going to need some tasty high value treats to give them something to work for.</p>
      <p>Choose something you know they love but don’t have every day - cooked chicken or cheese are often good options!</p>
      <h3 id="A safe space">A safe space</h3>
      <p>Safety is always key when training your dog, as there is always potential for accidents or falls.</p>
      <p>So, make sure you have plenty of space, and you move any objects that could cause injuries if your dog was to run or fall into them.</p>
      <h3 id="Consistent commands">Consistent commands</h3>
      <p>Consistency is key. Nailing down your commands and hand gestures before you get started will save your dog from getting confused and help them learn the tricks much quicker.</p>
      <p>Now you're prepped, you're ready to begin, here are Dr Emma's easy and fun training tricks.</p>
      <h2 id="Jumping over a hurdle">Jumping over a hurdle</h2>
      <p>This is a trick that requires patience as you will have to go about it in stages.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Firstly, you want to start with a hurdle low enough for your dog to step over and your dog on a lead.</li>
        <li>Begin simply walking your dog over the bar, marking it with a ‘yes’ and rewarding them with a treat every time they step over it. This will help them gain confidence around the hurdle, as well as getting over it.</li>
        <li>Once your dog has this nailed, you can slightly raise the bar and have your dog sit on one side whilst you are on the other. Try calling your dog over the hurdle, making sure they have a good view of their treat. Use the lead to guide them over if they are struggling.</li>
        <li>Once the dog reaches the other side, mark and reward.</li>
        <li>Again, once your dog is confident with this, you can start introducing the name of the command. This should be something such as ‘jump’ or ‘over’. Call your dog over the hurdle, and once their feet are off the ground, say your command and then mark and reward again once they get to you.</li>
        <li>You can then start increasing the height of the hurdle as your dog's confidence grows.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="Weaving through obstacles">Weaving through obstacles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Start by placing cones (if you don't have cones, placing plastic cups upside down is an easy alternative) in a straight line spaced evenly apart. To begin, make the gaps between each cone quite spacious. Once your dog is getting the hang of weaving, you can move the cones closer together to make it a little more challenging.</li>
        <li>Before encouraging your dog to weave through the cones, you want to get them familiar with following a treat. To do this, make it known to your pooch that you have a treat in your hand and work on getting them to follow your hand, marking with a ‘yes’ and the treat when they have followed your hand successfully.</li>
        <li>Once they are getting good at this, you can move to guide them through the cones, again with a treat in hand. Keep the treat close to your dog's snout and weave them through the cones.</li>
        <li>Once your dog reaches the end, mark and reward.</li>
        <li>Repeat this a few more times until your dog is following you confidently.</li>
        <li>Once they are, you can start introducing the command ‘weave’. Guide your dog again as they make their way through the cones, say ‘weave’ and once they complete the course, mark and reward.</li>
        <li>Continue practising this until your dog is confident.</li>
        <li>Once they are familiar with the command, you can move to start saying the command without having to guide your dog through the cones, marking and rewarding once they reach the end.</li>
        <li>If they struggle, that’s fine. Jump back a step and guide them through again.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="Running through a tunnel">Running through a tunnel</h2>
      <p>If you have children, you might have a play tunnel lying around. If not, you can make one by opening up the bottoms of some large cardboard boxes and placing them together.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Firstly you need to get your dog familiar with the tunnel, let your dog sniff and get close to it, and reward any positive behaviour towards the tunnel with a ‘yes’ and a tasty treat.</li>
        <li>Once you are happy that your dog doesn’t fear the tunnel, lay out a trail of treats through the tunnel to entice your dog to manoeuvre through it. Ideally, you will have one person holding your dog at one end and another person on the other to call and encourage the dog.</li>
        <li>When your dog reaches the end, give them lots of praise and extra treats and repeat this process until your dog is confidently moving through the tunnel.</li>
        <li>Now, repeat the last step without the treats in the tunnel, and save them for the end reward. Have one person call and encourage your dog to come through, and when they do, mark it with a ‘yes’ and a big reward.</li>
        <li>Repeat this until your dog is running through confidently every time, then move on to introducing the command.</li>
        <li>Once your dog steps into the tunnel, say a command such as ‘through’ to mark the action, and as normal, mark with a ‘yes’ and reward once they reach you on the other side.</li>
        <li>Repeat this as many times as you need to until your dog runs through the tunnel upon hearing the command without needing a treat on the other side.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="Spin on the spot">Spin on the spot</h2>
      <p>Teaching your dog to spin takes a lot of practice as it is a little trickier to master, but with plenty of patience and rewards, you and your dog will master it in no time.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with a treat held closely to your dog's snout and begin by luring them round to one side, as they start to turn, mark and reward with the treat.</li>
        <li>Repeat this a few times, ensuring you always lure them the same way until they get used to the motion of turning.</li>
        <li>Once your dog is confident with that, you want to start luring them in a full circle with the treat close to their snout. Your pooch won’t get this every time, so it is important to be patient and just go back to your starting point and try again, marking it with a ‘yes’ and rewarding once they have completed the full circle.</li>
        <li>Again, when your dog is confidently following your hand in a full circle motion, you can move on to incorporating the command, ‘spin’. Lure your dog round and as they start the movement, say the command, and when they finish, mark and reward.</li>
        <li>Continue repeating this until your dog gets it right every time.</li>
        <li>Only then can you start to try getting them to spin without luring them with a treat. You should get to a point where you can simply say ‘spin’, and your dog will know exactly what to do!</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="Additional things to note">Additional things to note</h3>
      <p>Spending quality time with your dog on the above can be very rewarding.</p>
      <p>It both mentally stimulates them as well as physically and can often strengthen the bond between you both.</p>
      <p>It's worth noting though to only practice these in short bursts as your dog will become very tired quickly. It is recommended 5 to 10 minutes on each exercise is enough per session and will help to keep it fun without your dog losing interest.</p>

  },
  content: `
<p>The school holidays aren’t just a fun time for your kids, but for your family dog too! Running around in the garden, endless entertainment and little friends who forever want to play with you - what’s not to love?</p>
      <p>But when the time comes for the kids to go back to school, your dog’s routine of playing all day, a constantly open back door and mid-day walkies goes out the window. So, as a dog parent, how can you ensure the transition from a busy, kid-filled household to radio silence doesn’t mess around with your dog’s well-being?</p>
      <p>The last thing your family needs is a stressed-out dog on top of back-to-school chaos, so read on for all the tips, tricks and info you need, including expert advice from Vet Linda, to ensure a happy and fulfilled pooch!</p>
      <h2 id="How the school holidays might affect your dog">How the school holidays might affect your dog</h2>
      <p>School holidays can feel like they last a lifetime, and for your dog, it can bring a massive flip to their daily routine. But what exactly changes for them?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Later starts. No school run means everyone gets a precious lie-in. But a pup who usually looks forward to an 8 am breakfast will have to adapt to a new routine that now kicks off a few hours later.</li>
        <li>More playful days. With the kids being in the house more, your dog will probably be the centre of attention - with permanent playmates that can match their energy levels and don’t mind throwing the ball over and over again.</li>
        <li>A fuller house. Whether you have a couple of children or just one who loves to invite their friends over during the holidays, your pup will grow accustomed to a much busier household. From meeting new faces to all the excitement of having more people to play with, your dog will have gotten used to the increased footfall.</li>
        <li>More days in the garden. If we’re lucky enough to get some nice weather during the school holidays, the back door to the garden is most likely to be always open to make way for all the outside fun. For your pup, this means constant access to much-needed toilet breaks - without the need to ask!</li>
        <li>More adventures with the whole family. With the kids at home, you’ll want to have more adventures as a family, and that includes the dog too! So whether you’re filling days with hiking, a trip to the beach or even just having Sunday lunch in a dog-friendly pub garden, your dog will be used to spending more time out of the house.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="How does back-to-school time impact your dog’s well-being?">How does back-to-school time impact your dog’s well-being?</h2>
      <p>Whether it’s been a week or six weeks, your pup would have caught on to the sudden change. So of course when the first day of school rolls around, things go from hectic and lively to quiet and mellow. You might not think twice about it, but your pup may be feeling the effects.</p>
      <p>Suddenly with being left alone more, fewer people to see and everyone being too busy to play, your dog may suffer from the following;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stress</li>
        <li>Separation anxiety</li>
        <li>Boredom (which may lead to destructive behaviour)</li>
        <li>Hyperactivity</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="How to help your dog with the transition">How to help your dog with the transition</h2>
      <p>You might be thinking about getting your kids ready for back-to-school season, but you can also do the same for your pup! Preparing them for the transition early will make it easier for them to adapt to the sudden change in routine.</p>
      <p>We asked expert Vet Linda to share her thoughts on where to start when considering prepping your pooch, and why it’s so important:</p>
      <p>“A new routine can be stressful for a dog to cope with, especially if they're younger or more anxious by nature. If your dog needs to be left alone for the school run and is not used to this, they may find it hard to cope. This can lead to destructive behaviour when left alone e.g. digging, chewing or barking. To prevent this, owners could get their dog gradually used to being left alone for short periods when the school run would be. To make this more successful, it is a good idea to provide some exercise before then (wearing them out) and to give them something to do while away e.g. a food puzzle or chew.”</p>
      <p>“For very anxious dogs who will be unsettled by the changes, consider starting some calming supplements a week or so beforehand.”</p>
      <p>Including those that Vet Linda mentioned, there are a few other things you can do in the few weeks leading up to the first day of school, to make sure you have a happy pup:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prioritising early mornings. In the last couple of weeks of the holiday, prioritise getting up earlier, preferably at the time the house will soon be waking up to get ready for school. This way you can reintroduce bright and early toilet breaks and feeding time to your dog ready for when alarm clocks are ringing!</li>
        <li>Practice leaving them at home. With the return of the school run and everyone being back at work and school, your pup will have to get used to being home alone a lot more. This may be difficult to slip back into, but you can start practising early on to make it a little bit easier. Try leaving them at home whilst running little errands or popping to the local shop, gradually lengthening the time you’re leaving them.

For peace of mind, you could consider;

- Taking them for a walk first thing in the morning.
- Asking someone to pop in to let them out or keep them company.
- Invest in enrichment toys and tasty treats to curve boredom.
- Adding a camera so you can check up on them.
- Leaving on background noise, like on a smart speaker, to emulate a busy household.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Revisiting toilet training. After having open access to the garden and more toilet breaks during the holidays, you might want to consider refreshing your pup’s toilet training.

This might include cracking down on those early-morning toilet breaks, as well as letting them out before you leave to ensure they know when to hold it whilst you’re gone. Asking someone to pop in and let them out might help them in the first few weeks.</li>
        <li>Prioritise lots of exercise. After running around and going on lots of family adventures during the holidays, back-to-school might mean going back to regular suburban walks for your dog as you get back to reality. That said, try and prioritise lots of exercise for your dog to help keep them stimulated and happy. A tired dog is a happy dog!</li>
        <li>Distraction, play and enrichment. The same goes for their mental stimulation! Be sure to whip out all the toys, chews, treat stuffers and snuffle mats to keep your dog enriched and happily none the wiser.</li>
        <li>Encouraging a calm and relaxed atmosphere. Going back to work and school will mean the whole household will be ready to wind down in the evenings. Make sure your dog is aware of this too by creating a calmer and more relaxed atmosphere in the evenings.

All dogs are a sucker for a routine, so letting your pup know that the evening is time for cuddles and naps, they’ll eventually get the picture.</li>
        <li>Lots of love and attention! Back-to-school season can be a whirlwind at times, and weeks seem to fly by. But amongst all the hustle and bustle, don’t forget to put some time aside to give your dog some well-deserved TLC. Prioritising bonding, love and cuddles with your pup won’t only make them feel better, but you too.</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Before you know it, life can get so busy. But as dog parents, we should always try to stop and think about how it might be affecting our dogs, and consider what we can do to ensure they’re feeling safe and happy. Our Calm & Relaxed range of treats, dental sticks, supplements, dry and wet food can help ease excitable or nervous dogs and could be just what you need to help them transition to the back-to-school season.

<p>Although framed as a momentous milestone in many people’s lives, moving house is one of the most stressful things you can do. Not just for your family, but your dog too!</p>
      <p>This big life change may be scary and stressful for both you and your dog, but there are lots of things you can consider to help the process run smoothly - and get your pooch adjusted and settled as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>With the help of Pooch’s Vet Linda, we’ve brought you all the expert tips, tricks, checklists and advice you’ll need to prepare your dog for moving day - and what to expect as you work at getting their life back on track in their new home.</p>
      <h2 id="How can moving house affect your dog?">How can moving house affect your dog?</h2>
      <p>As you ponder over your moving checklist, and all of the stuff you’re yet to pack, you may be looking over at your snoring pooch, jealous they’re none the wiser. However, they’re paying more attention than you think.

Here’s Vet Linda to tell you exactly how dogs can be affected by moving house:

“Moving house can be a stressful occasion for all, but particularly pets. Most dogs crave routine and like to have a structured and predictable home life. So, when we pack up their belongings and show up in a whole new place, it can be overwhelming.

In the early days, you may notice your dog seems worried as they display behaviours such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lip-licking</li>
        <li>Yawning</li>
        <li>Pacing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your dog may also initially show their stress by acting clingy or by hiding away. Some dogs may start "acting out" and displaying more unwanted behaviours, such as barking, chewing and digging. This is why being mindful to include your dog’s wellbeing during the moving process should be a priority, especially when wanting to avoid some of these behaviours long term."</p>
      <h2 id="Conducting house viewings with a dog">Conducting house viewings with a dog</h2>
      <p>A crucial part of starting the moving process is making your home look as pristine as possible while you host property viewings.</p>
      <p>But having strangers coming to your house more than usual, and keeping a house looking tidy with a rambunctious pooch in the vicinity, can prove to be a little tricky.</p>
      <p>So if you’re trying to give the best impression to a potential buyer, here are a few things to consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Arrange a dog sitter at the time of viewings. It’s impossible to imagine, but not everyone’s a fan of dogs!</li>
        <li>Alternatively, ask your partner or a family member to take your dog for a walk during the viewing.</li>
        <li>Tidy up your dog’s space to not completely eradicate your dog’s presence, but to make it in-keeping with the rest of your home.</li>
        <li>Ensure your garden’s poop free!</li>
        <li>Vacuum and get rid of any excessive dog hair.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="Preparing your dog before moving day">Preparing your dog before moving day</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a calm atmosphere. Try not to fuss over your dog too much as you pack as they’ll quickly feel that something’s not right.

The best thing to do is act as normal as possible; going about your daily routine amongst your prepping and packing, while using calming speech and body language to keep your pooch as zen as possible.

Looking for a little something to give a helping paw for a relaxed dog? Our extensive Calm and Relaxed range including dry and wet food, dental sticks, treats, fish hide chews and deliciously chewy supplements, are packed with natural ingredients like chamomile, hemp and valerian root to help turn nervous dogs into chilled-out pooches.

So, why not treat your pup to Calming Probiotic Meaty Treats or a Hemp Chewy to help them kick back whilst you pack?

CALMING RANGE</li>
        <li>Lots of distraction. Keep your pooch busy! Take some time away from packing to go on a big walk, visit some family and friends, play ball in the garden or do whatever they love to do. This way they’re getting some well-deserved attention, and they’ll be too pooped to notice you collapsing the dining room table.</li>
        <li>Enrichment and mental stimulation. Whip out the treat stuffers and snuffle mats to keep your pooch busy. Not only are they mentally stimulating, but they also ensure a tuckered-out pup.</li>
        <li>Leave their favourite things out. While packing, remember to keep your dog’s stuff out until the last minute. This way, whilst the rest of the house is being packed up, they can enjoy the familiarity of their belongings and most importantly, their scent.</li>
        <li>Visiting your new area. Take trips with your dog to the area around your new house. This will help introduce them to their new neighbourhood, and provide some fun enrichment to break up a day of packing.</li>
        <li>Make plans for moving day. If moving day would be easier and safer without them there, ask family or friends to watch them for a couple of hours. Alternatively, you could take your dog and their belongings to the new house first or last. This way they can explore in their own time without any distractions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="What to do with your dog on moving day">What to do with your dog on moving day</h2>
      <p>So the big day has arrived!</p>
      <p>With so much to do and people in and out of your house all day, the last thing you want to be worrying about is your dog getting lost amongst boxes or going off on an adventure through an open front door.</p>
      <p>That said, here are a few things you can do on moving day to ensure it’s smooth sailing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Get your dog sorted first. Start their day with a delicious calming treat like a Hemp Chewy or Calming Fish Hide Chew and get them settled in their own space with their belongings (whether that’s at the new house or the old).</li>
        <li>Hand them over to a friend or family member for the day. Alternatively, give them a break from the madness at a family or friends’ house, and pick them up when the chaos has settled.</li>
        <li>Make a safe zone, informing everyone helping you move of their whereabouts. Wherever you decide to set-up your pooch, be sure to create a calming, secure area away from the chaos, and full of their belongings and fun distractions. Also, make everyone aware to avoid any escape opportunities.</li>
        <li>Stick to your routine as much as possible. If you walk them every morning, walk them on the morning of your move.</li>
        <li>Let them explore at their own pace. Whether they get first looks before anyone gets there, or they run around once everyone’s gone - give your pooch time to sniff and get acquainted with their new home.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="Travelling with your dog">Travelling with your dog</h3>
      <p>Moving with a dog inevitably means travelling with them too - whether that’s in the moving van or the car.</p>
      <p>Travelling with your pooch also takes some preparation, especially if they’re not used to it. That said, here’s how you can tackle travelling with your dog:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure you have the right accessories. This includes their seat belt harness, car seat, blanket and seat cover. Dogs have to be suitably restrained in a car by law, to ensure no distractions and everyone’s safety.</li>
        <li>Make the car a positive space. If your dog only gets in the car to go to the vet, start taking some fun trips on the build-up to moving day, to lessen the stress on the day.</li>
        <li>Tackle nausea. Car sickness is common in dogs, so be prepared. Ask your vet about nausea medication to be taken before the journey, as well as making sure you’re equipped with cleaning supplies.</li>
        <li>Tire them out before the journey. Take them out for a walk or get in some playtime to tucker them out, so they’ll hopefully sleep during the journey.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="Helping your dog settle into their new home">Helping your dog settle into their new home</h2>
      <p>Whether it's new smells, a new sleeping space, a new garden or a new walking route, there’s SO much for your dog to take in.</p>
      <p>So, after the chaos of moving is settling down, consider the following when helping your dog adjust to their new surroundings.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stick to your usual routine as much as possible, whether that’s walks, feeding times or playtime.</li>
        <li>Vet Linda also recommends ‘arranging to stay home as much as possible with your dog for the initial settling period’ to avoid separation anxiety.</li>
        <li>Allow for behaviour that’s out of character, which could include whining through the night or having little accidents around the house. With the right approach, they should revert to normal once settled.</li>
        <li>Prepare for some retraining, especially at night.</li>
        <li>Rebuild their own area/sleeping quarters, with their belongings that smell like your previous house.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>However stressed or anxious you may be feeling about moving with your dog, know that you’re not alone. And no matter how chaotic the moving process has been with your dog, you’ll be able to look back at it with fond memories.

Eventually anyway!

Just take some of these moving stories from our honorary Poochers:</p>

      <h3 id="How long does it take for a dog to adjust to a move?">How long does it take for a dog to adjust to a move?</h3>
      <p>The amount of time it takes for them to settle and adjust will be different for every dog. For some it may take a week, for others, it may take a month, or even longer.</p>
      <p>It also depends on how you’ve approached the move with your dog, and what you do to help them adjust. Helping your pooch to gradually get acquainted with their new space, whilst sticking to their routine as closely as you can, AND creating positive experiences should help speed up the settling process.</p>
      <h3 id="What signs show your dog is adjusting to the move?">What signs show your dog is adjusting to the move?</h3>
      <p>After some time, your pooch will become adjusted and settled in their new home. Some signs of this happening include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Out-of-character behaviour ceases.</li>
        <li>The behaviour they used to display in their old home continues. I.e. waiting at the back door to be let out for the toilet.</li>
        <li>They begin sleeping through the night.</li>
        <li>They sleep more during the day around the house.</li>
        <li>They’re open to playing more.</li>
        <li>They’re eating and drinking well.</li>
        <li>Poops are normal and healthy.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="Do dogs get homesick?">Do dogs get homesick?</h3>
      <p>Those who move with cats may have stories about their homesick cat trying to make their way back to their old house. Whilst it’s less common in dogs, there have been instances of dogs attempting an escape not long after moving to their new home. More commonly, dogs who’ve recently moved house usually kick up more of a fuss than they once did when left alone.</p>
      <p>However, this is most likely due to stress and separation anxiety caused by the move, and a change of routine and environment. When moving with your dog, you should prepare as much as you can to make the move as stress-free as possible. This can be done using scent swaps, gradual exposure and positive reinforcement.</p>

<p>If we’re lucky, our dogs can be with us for up to 13 years, if not longer. They’re by our side for some of life’s major moments, and they truly cement themselves as an integral part of the family.</p>
      <p>As much as we don’t want to think about it, there will come a day when we will have to say goodbye to our beloved furry friend, and for those who have never experienced the loss of a pet, it really can impact your life in many ways.</p>
      <p>As each of our dogs are different, so are the ways we deal with their loss. We’re not saying it will ever be an easy process, but we’re here to support you with some ways that can help you through this difficult time - and make things a little more manageable for you and your family.</p>
      <h2 id="Dealing with the loss of your senior dog">Dealing with the loss of your senior dog</h2>
      <p>Just like that, your beloved companion has grown a little salt and pepper and doesn’t move around quite as quickly as they used to.</p>
      <p>Some people may think that having a senior dog might make saying an anticipatory goodbye a little easier. However, when you’ve been lucky enough to have a lifetime of unconditional love, it can be just as hard when the time does come.</p>
      <h2>Although difficult, caring for a senior dog near the end can indeed make it easier to <strong>prepare</strong> for their eventual passing. This could be knowing the signs that may indicate their final days are here, or placing focus on making your dog extra comfortable.</h2>
      <h3 id="Your senior dog Looking for signs">Your senior dog Looking for signs</h3>
      <p>As hard as it will be, looking out for signs that your senior dog is in their few final days can provide a kindness in your grieving process, as it gives you the time to make the necessary preparations.</p>
      <p>Signs that might tell you that your senior dog is nearing the end of their life include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Difficulty walking or being unsteady on their feet.</li>
        <li>Unable to control their peeing and pooping, resulting in regular accidents around the house.</li>
        <li>Extreme lethargy and fatigue.</li>
        <li>A lack of eating and drinking, and unmotivated by their favourite treat.</li>
        <li>Seizures and tremors.</li>
        <li>Noticeable swelling or tumours on their body.</li>
        <li>Dull coat and glassy eyes.</li>
        <li>Diarrhoea and/or vomiting.</li>
        <li>Extreme and sudden weight loss.</li>
        <li>They want to be on their own a lot more.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When you know that final goodbye is around the corner, you can make necessary preparations to ensure your dog is as happy and comfortable as possible - as well as gradually easing yourself into this new, and difficult process.

These preparations may include;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make your dog extra comfortable with bedding, blankets and even their own private area.</li>
        <li>Making your vet aware of the situation.</li>
        <li>Switching up their diet may help support them during their final days, by aiding their ailments.

Senior dog food should focus a little more attention on nutrition and functionality, with healthy ingredients and added supplements to help with aspects like pain relief and mobility.</li>
        <li>Make your home safe and easy to manoeuvre for your senior dog. This could include keeping them off wooden flooring that could be slippery, keeping them on one level to avoid stairs, or moving the location of their food and water supply.</li>
        <li>Focus on pain relief if necessary.</li>
        <li>Having honest conversations with younger members of the family that it’s nearly time to say goodbye.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Take some time just for yourself, like getting some fresh air, meditating, finding distractions or giving yourself a break away from the situation.</li>
        <li>If possible, take some time off work.</li>
        <li>Don’t forget to talk. Airing your feelings to friends and family about the situation could surprisingly make you feel a little lighter.</li>
        <li>Remember the good times. Take time to think about all the precious memories you had with your dog, and everything you’re thankful for.</li>
        <li>Celebrate your dog’s life. Take time as a family to discuss ways you can commemorate them once they’ve passed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>For anyone with a dog, euthanasia is hopefully a last resort. And despite being the most humane thing to do in many cases, it can still carry feelings of despair, grief and guilt. <br><br> However, vets will <strong>only</strong> recommend euthanasia if the treatment they’ve offered isn’t helping, or if alternative treatments aren’t working and your dog is continuing to suffer.<br><br></h2>
      <h2 id="How to prepare yourself for putting your dog to sleep">How to prepare yourself for putting your dog to sleep</h2>
      <p>The final decision will always sit with you and your family. However, your vet is there to offer their expert advice and support. If you’re faced with the impossible decision of having to put your dog to sleep, here are a few things you can do to prepare;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Discuss your decision with the whole family. Be honest and talk about why there aren’t any other options left, and the concept of being humane.</li>
        <li>Approach younger children with care, preparing how to tell them in advance.</li>
        <li>Talk about the realistic outcomes if you don’t opt for euthanasia. Is your dog going to have a good quality of life? Will medication cure them? Are they going to be in pain? Are you in a position to provide around-the-clock care and medication?</li>
        <li>Talk to your vet about the process and get the answers to any questions you may have.</li>
        <li>Discuss who will stay with your dog during euthanasia, as it may bring some comfort to both you and your dog.</li>
        <li>If possible, take some time off work to process what you’re going through.</li>
        <li>Discuss how you’d like to commemorate your dog, for example, whether you’d want them cremated or buried.</li>
        <li>Prioritise your mental wellbeing.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="Coping with the sudden loss of your dog">Coping with the sudden loss of your dog</h2>
      <p>Sadly, not all dog owners are fortunate enough to see their dogs grow old. The unpredictability of life can bring instances where they can be lost in tragic accidents, or by sudden illness.</p>
      <p>Losing a dog in any capacity is one of the hardest things a dog parent can go through, but a sudden loss can be very difficult to process.</p>
      <p>Losing your dog suddenly can certainly turn your world upside down. But there are small things you can do to ensure you’re taking each day as it comes, and prioritising your mental well-being.</p>
      <p>The following can help you cope with the sudden loss of your dog;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Give yourself time to grieve.
Don’t ever brush off your loss - dogs play such a huge role in our lives and how we approach grief and sadness will differ from person to person.

Take all the time you need to grieve; put off other events, taking time for yourself, or even taking some time off work if possible.</li>
        <li>Rely on your vet for support.
They’ll understand better than anyone what you’re going through and will be able to provide expert advice and answer any questions you may have.

If you’re struggling and need to speak to someone regarding your grief, be sure to check out the Blue Cross charity pet bereavement helpline. This will provide an open, non-judgmental space for you, with experts to help you through your grief.</li>
        <li>Put aside some time to think about the next steps.
As a family, you can dedicate some time to celebrate your dog’s life, whether that includes recalling the good times, deciding how you’ll keep their memory alive or commemorate them, or even asking the vet if you’re able to save a lock of fur or even a pawprint.

If your pup is cremated, this is often offered as a part of the cremation service.</li>
        <li>If you have any other pets, make sure to give them lots of love.
Not only will it make you feel better, but they’ll also be impacted by the change.</li>
        <li>If you have your children, prepare something to tell them.
This might be that your beloved dog has crossed the ‘rainbow bridge’, or anything else that might be easier for young children to understand.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="How to help children to understand losing your dog">How to help children to understand losing your dog</h2>
      <p>Your dog becomes a part of your family, and many children would never have known their home without their furry friend. So when the time comes where you have to say goodbye to your dog, how do you explain this loss to young children?</p>
      <p>No matter how you approach informing your children, there’s going to be some upset. However, there are ways to delicately approach the subject that avoid lots of tears and misunderstandings - especially for very young children.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Try to be as honest as possible. Telling white lies, like saying your dog’s ‘gone to live on a farm’ or ‘ran away’ may cause even more confusion, or make them believe they’re coming back. This will only cause more upset if questions continue to persist.</li>
        <li>Use the Rainbow Bridge analogy. ‘Crossing the Rainbow Bridge’ is a common way for people to let others know their pet has passed away. Letting young children know that your dog has ‘crossed the rainbow bridge’ is a kinder way to approach telling them about their passing.</li>
        <li>Let them express their feelings. Grief shows itself in very different ways, especially with children who may have never come across death before. Allow them to express their feelings in any way they want - whether that’s to cry, feel angry or be in denial.</li>
        <li>Support them however they feel, don’t be afraid to show your own feelings and be there to offer love, patience and answers when they come to you. And hey, a cuddle wouldn’t hurt - and would probably do you some good too!</li>
        <li>Use books as a support. It’s likely that your child will spend time thinking about what’s happened. There are lots of different materials and books out there, which could really help them to understand and unpack their feelings. Whether it’s fiction or non-fiction, take some time to choose a book or story that you think they might connect with.</li>
        <li>Help them remember. Celebrate your dog’s life with your children by talking about the good times, asking them their favourite memories or encouraging them to make something for a shrine or memorial. By getting them to think creatively, you can keep them occupied whilst your family begins the mourning process.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="Helping your other dog through loss">Helping your other dog through loss</h3>
      <p>A recent study shows that nearly a quarter of all dog owners own more than one dog. This means that the passing of your dog could likely mean your other dog is also suffering a loss.

Having multiple dogs in the family home often encourages unbreakable bonds and companionships between canines, and it’s believed that like humans, dogs can feel mournful when their best buddy passes.</p>
      <p>Signs of a mourning dog might include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Not as playful or lethargy.</li>
        <li>Lack of appetite.</li>
        <li>Whining</li>
        <li>Appearing to be more needy or clingy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The change of environment, atmosphere or even in your behaviour can also impact your pooch. This means helping your other dog through this difficult time is really important.</p>
      <p>Ways you can help your other dog include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Give them lots of attention.</li>
        <li>Try to keep their routine as normal as possible.</li>
        <li>Provide lots of distractions to keep them entertained.</li>
        <li>Keep treating good behaviour and encouraging positive reinforcement in this time of change.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="Ways to commemorate your dog">Ways to commemorate your dog</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating a memorial. Did your dog have a favourite place to walk? A preferred snooze spot in your garden? You could consider creating a memorial in this space to honour your dog’s life. This could be in the form of a bespoke plaque, something to plant or a kind gesture to other dogs - like offering tennis balls in a public place.

Make sure to check with your local council before erecting anything in a public space.</li>
        <li>Creating a photo album or scrapbook. You’re sure to have reels upon reels of pictures of your pooch. So why not spend an afternoon placing some of those photos in frames or placing them in a scrapbook? You can discuss your favourite memories and all the good times they brought forth whilst you do so.</li>
        <li>Displaying their favourite belongings or collars. Clearing out your dog’s things will surely be one of the hardest things to do after they’ve passed. Be sure to save some of their favourite things, like a toy, blanket or even their collar to display in remembrance. These can either sit on the shelf as an everyday reminder, or in a display case or frame.</li>
        <li>Preserving their paw or nose print. If you’re lucky enough to be able to say goodbye to your dog before they pass, you could take a final print of their paw or nose to have a part of them forever. This can either be an ink print or in soft clay.</li>
        <li>Bespoke art or jewellery. With dogs having a special place in all of our hearts, it’s easy to find small businesses that make bespoke jewellery or art from a picture of your dog. This makes for a beautiful token which you can keep forever. Some companies can place some of your dog’s ashes in a piece of jewellery. Wearing this could offer some real comfort, knowing they’re always with you, continuing on together through life’s journey.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Spreading their ashes or holding a burial. If you decide to cremate your pup or bring them back home, you could hold a service to spread their ashes or give them a final resting place. Although rare, pet burial grounds do exist, but the current most common method is cremation.

Always check with your local council before spreading ashes or conducting burials in a public place.</li>

<p>Being a pooch paps is one of the most wholesome jobs in the world.</p>
      <p>Being responsible for a precious bundle of waggy-ness, and making their life feel fun, fulfilled and healthy is irreplaceable. And of course, the endless joy they bring in return is priceless.</p>
      <p>So whether this Father’s Day you’re looking for some dad & dog bonding time, or you’re planning a memorable day for a deserving dog dad in your life - then look no further.</p>
      <h2 id="A zen kind of Father’s Day">A zen kind of Father’s Day</h2>
      <p>If you’re on the hunt for a more chilled kind of celebration, we have plenty of ideas up our sleeve:</p>
      <p>1. Breakfast in bed - Change up the morning and enjoy breakfast in bed together. There’s no morning like a morning filled with slobbery kisses. Enjoy your bestest breakfast in comfort together - there’s even certain foods you can both have a bowl of.</p>
      <p>Dogs love eggs, just make sure they’re fed in moderation and without any added extra ingredients or seasoning.</p>
      <h2><br><strong>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;</strong><b>A movie marathon - </b><span>Get your hooman and </span><a href="https://www.poochandmutt.co.uk/collections/treats-for-dogs"><span>pooch snacks</span></a><span> at the ready, a glass (and bowl) of your favourite tipples (there’s some great doggo-friendly options out there!) and flick over to your chosen streaming site.&nbsp;</span><br>If there’s something in particular your fur bestie loves to watch, then stick it on and snuggle up.</h2>
      <p>Our guess is something that's animal related will get their tail wagging…</p>
      <p>3. Bubble-gun fun - Limited movement needed from you, and loads of fun for them. Plan ahead and invest in a bubble-gun, fill with dog-friendly bubbles (you can get flavours like bacon or cheese, just to name a couple), and watch them pop away.</p>
      <p>Their reaction will have you in stitches, and they’ll never want you to put them away.</p>
      <h2 id="An adventurous kind of Father’s Day">An adventurous kind of Father’s Day</h2>
      <p>If being out-and-about together is more your vibe, then check out our suggestions below:</p>
      <p>1. A Sunday of sports - Who says sports are just for playing with your mates? Not us. There’s plenty of sports your pooch will love to play with you (just don’t bring a ref along). Try football by dribbling the ball and letting them try to tackle you, or practice some penalties and watch them chase the ball across the pitch.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, get your tennis ball and racket, practice your swings against a wall and allow them to play ball kid.</p>
      <h2><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong><b>A dad &amp; dog hike - </b><span>If you’re the hiking types, then get your walking gear together and appreciate hours of bonding with great views. Pick a new hike you’ve not done before to make it feel super special - they’ll love all the new sights, sounds and smells. </span></h2>
      <p>Don’t forget to pack plenty of water, treats and poo bags.</p>
      <p>3. Waggy on the water - Most dogs love being around water, and there’s plenty of boat hires that allow your pooch to accompany you when out. So whether it’s a canoe, kayak or sailing boat - get your life jackets on and spend some quality time in mother father nature.</p>
      <p>Let us know what you've been up to to celebrate!</p>

<p>Did you know, there's a whole yellow army of dogs out there? These are dogs who wear bright yellow collars, leads and harnesses when out on a walk. The yellow colour is a signal to other owners that this is a dog who doesn't want to be approached.</p>
      <h2><strong>National Dogs in Yellow Day falls on 20th March</strong> - and we want to raise awareness! If you're taking part then help to raise awareness by posting a picture of your gorgeous pooch on social media. Let’s get this trending...</h2>

      <h2 id="Why would a dog not want to be approached?">Why would a dog not want to be approached?</h2>
      <p>There are lots of reasons why a pet may need space when out of their house. This would include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fear or anxiety around people or other dogs</li>
        <li>The potential to act aggressive</li>
        <li>The need for space as they're being trained so their owner wants distractions kept to a minimum</li>
        <li>Being unwell or elderly; not every dog wants a bouncy puppy running over to play!</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="How does the initiative help?">How does the initiative help?</h2>
      <p>If both dog and owner know they're going to get a peaceful and uninterrupted walk, they're more likely to enjoy their time spent outdoors.</p>
      <p>Both will feel more relaxed and can work on building confidence together. It also makes sure that everyone involved is kept safe and happy.</p>
      <p>If the pooch is yellow ends up distressed as their personal space has been invaded - it could end up being a traumatic experience for both sets of owners and dogs.</p>
      <h2 id="Signs of an anxious dog">Signs of an anxious dog</h2>
      <p>It's not always obvious when your dog is nervous. Each dog can express their nerves in a different way. However, it's useful to be able to read our dog’s body language, to get a better understanding of what's going on inside their head.</p>
      <p>Signs to watch out for include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Staying close to you and not wanting to sniff or explore</li>
        <li>Shaking or whining Humping or over-excitement</li>
        <li>Panting</li>
        <li>A desire to go back home right away, or refusing to go on the walk altogether</li>
        <li>Barking or lunging at other dogs or people</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="If you own an anxious dog…">If you own an anxious dog…</h2>
      <p>If you're the owner, it makes sense to have your dog wear a yellow lead and harness to avoid altercations. Try to stay calm, so your dog doesn’t pick up on your nerves.</p>
      <p>Stick to quieter routes and you can always cross the road if another dog's approaching in the distance.</p>
      <p>Have a steady supply of tasty treats such as our Pooch & Mutt Calming Probiotic Meaty Treats. Not only will your dog be glad to have a yummy distraction, these treats contain natural ingredients such as Valerian Root and Chamomile, to help make your dog less reactive.</p>
      <p>It can help to keep your pooch focused, by asking simple commands throughout the walk - and consider taking along some distracting toys like a frisbee or tug toy. The aim is for your dog to associate walks with good feelings!</p>
      <h2 id="If you notice another dog is anxious…">If you notice another dog is anxious…</h2>
      <p>If you spot a dog in yellow, or notice they seem afraid, give them plenty of space. They don't need you or your dog coming up to them, no matter how gentle or friendly your pup is.</p>
      <p>If your dog's off-lead, you should really clip them back on so you're sure they won't approach the dog in yellow.</p>
      <p>This is really important if there's a chance they'll want to greet the nervous dog. Remember, not only is it unfair for the nervous pooch to have another dog causing them distress, they may resort to snapping if very afraid - which could result in trauma or a vet visit for your own furry friend.</p>

  content: `
<p>As Crufts comes around for another year, the sight of those bright-eyed, flouncy pooches gliding across the arena may have you thinking, ‘Hmm. My dog could do with a glow-up…’</p>
      <p>We’re sure you don’t need telling: it benefits everyone to maintain your dog’s grooming. Not only will they look and smell lovely all the time, a regular grooming routine will have them feeling light, comfortable and well-cared for.</p>
      <p>If you’re wondering how to groom a dog at home, we’ve got you covered. By the time you’ve followed this step-by-step guide to grooming your dog, your newly fresh and fragrant pooch will be deemed best in show!</p>
      <h2 id="Step 1 Preparation">Step 1 Preparation</h2>
      <p>To start the pampering session, get your grooming space, tools and pooch ready.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gather your grooming tools together in a clean, soothing space. For preparation and clipping, a waterproof mat in a calm space will do. For bathing, the bathroom or an outdoor bathtub works. Ideally it should be somewhere your dog won’t be too distracted by other goings-on.</li>
        <li>Your tools should include: a bathtub, dog grooming scissors or clippers, nail clippers (if necessary), dog combs and brushes, soft washcloths, and lots of towels for drying and over-splash.</li>
        <li>Shampoos and conditioning treatments should be on hand for the bathing portion of events, and calming treats for dogs will also come in handy to reward good behaviour. It’s anyone’s guess whether your pooch will appreciate this grooming session, so play it safe by getting them as calm and comfortable as possible. Be sure they’ve been for a walk and to the toilet already. If it feels more secure, perhaps clip their collar to their lead to keep them still (you can remove it when bathing).</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="Step 2 Cleaning your dog’s face">Step 2 Cleaning your dog’s face</h2>
      <p>Begin with pampering your dog’s face and then work down through the body. Your dog’s face is very sensitive, and some don’t like it when you come this close. Take regular breaks, but if your pooch snaps, gets aggressive or doesn’t seem happy throughout, it’s ok to stop and try another time.</p>
      <h3 id="Eyes">Eyes</h3>
      <p>Your dog’s eyes can be a prime area for grime and gunk to build up, usually from tears or long fur. Keep them clean by using a damp cloth to carefully wipe away grime or crusty bits. While you’re there, check for any redness or irritation - do the eyes seem clear and healthy? If not, it could be worth a vet visit or some diet tweaks (e.g.. sore eyes could indicate a vitamin A deficiency).</p>
      <h3 id="Ears">Ears</h3>
      <p>Next, use a damp cloth to gently wipe away grime and wax from the inner and outer ears. You can use cotton balls instead, but never use cotton buds/q-tips. It’s natural for wax to build up in a dog’s ears, but it shouldn’t smell bad, nor should it hurt your pooch to have their ears touched. If either of these things occur, take note to see a vet, as your dog could have an ear infection.</p>
      <h3 id="Nose">Nose</h3>
      <p>Give your dog’s nostrils a soft wipe with a clean cloth, and check that the nose is moist. A dog’s nose should be wet most of the time, except perhaps when they’re sleeping.</p>
      <h3 id="Teeth">Teeth</h3>
      <p>Brushing your dog’s teeth is all part of a regular grooming routine, so take this opportunity to work on their gums and chompers with a soft, doggy toothbrush. We know that teeth-brushing can be a palaver for dog-owners, as many dogs infamously hate having them cleaned. Read our article on brushing your dog’s teeth for lots of advice on tooth-brushing techniques, and other smart ways to improve your dog’s dental health.</p>
      <h2 id="Step 3 Giving your pooch a manicurepedicure">Step 3 Giving your pooch a manicurepedicure</h2>
      <p>Why not treat your pooch to a mani/pedi? Some dogs don’t need their nails trimmed as walking on pavements files them down enough; but for some breeds whose claws are tougher, or for dogs who don’t walk much (older dogs, for example), cutting them could be a necessity. Generally, if you can hear your dog’s claws tapping on the ground during walks, they need clipping.</p>
      <p>Ask your vet if cutting their nails is necessary before trying it at home. If your dog’s nails are very long, i.e. they haven’t been clipped for a long time, do not attempt to clip at home - a vet can start off this process for you.</p>
      <h3 id="Cleaning paws">Cleaning paws</h3>
      <p>Pooch paws see a lot of grime, and mud and dirt can get clogged between your dog’s little toe pads. Before you start nail-clipping, carefully clean between them with a wet brush and/or cloth.</p>
      <h3 id="Trimming nails">Trimming nails</h3>
      <p>Use a special nail clipper made for use on dogs, and ensure your dog is calm and comfortable. Here are some tips for clipping dogs’ nails:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Don’t act nervously or restrain your dog too firmly while clipping, as this will make them anxious - just hold them gently as you lift each paw. They should sense your confidence and feel serene throughout.</li>
        <li>Clip each nail bit by bit; in slivers rather than ‘all in one’. There's a sensitive blood supply full of nerve-endings within each claw called the ‘quick’, and it’s important to avoid the quick while clipping a dog’s nails or you could hurt them. Trimming a small piece of nail at a time will help.</li>
        <li>Trim the dewclaws - these are basically doggy thumbs (!) and appear higher up your dog’s leg, almost by the ankle. Some dogs have dewclaws removed as a puppy, but if your pooch has them, it’s important they’re trimmed down too.</li>
        <li>Consider trimming your dog’s nails after bathing them, if you think they’ll feel more relaxed then. Slip your pooch some calming dog treats after each claw is successfully clipped - they’ll need positive association with manicure time!</li>
        <li>If you don’t feel confident clipping your dog’s nails, do get a vet or a professional groomer to do it for you.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="Step 4 Shampooing your dog’s coat">Step 4 Shampooing your dog’s coat</h2>
      <p>Your dog is almost prepped for bath time. Make sure there’s a non-slip mat in the tub to keep your pooch from slipping, and have all your supplies within reach so you don’t have to run around at any point, leaving your dog unattended.</p>
      <h3 id="Brushing and coat prep">Brushing and coat prep</h3>
      <p>Before bathing, give your dog a preliminary brush out, getting rid of any tangles or particularly coarse sections of fur. If there are any stubborn matted parts, cut those out with scissors if possible. It’s important to do this before bathing your dog, as sometimes getting matted fur wet can make these sections even tougher.</p>
      <h3 id="Get them wet">Get them wet</h3>
      <h2>Time to get wet! Ideally use a shower attachment on a bath for this, but if that isn’t available you can use a hose or jugs of water. The <strong>water should be lukewarm</strong> - not too hot or too cold.</h2>
      <p>Get your dog used to the sensation of the water, comforting them throughout. Don’t shock them with a sudden hosing but gradually soak their fur in portions, focusing on the neck down (be more gentle with water around the face and neck).</p>
      <h3 id="Shampoo the body">Shampoo the body</h3>
      <p>Be sure your pooch is soaked through before applying shampoo, then get your dog good and sudsy, following the instructions on the bottle. Massage into your dog’s coat, all over their body. Consider using a comb or dog brush at this time to really penetrate your dog’s fur with the product, especially if your dog’s double-coated.</p>
      <p>Rinse with the shower or hose, being sure to get all the product out (depending on your dog’s coat thickness, this could take a while!). Avoid their face and eyes, focus on the neck down first.</p>
      <h3 id="Shampoo face and head">Shampoo face and head</h3>
      <p>When wetting your dog’s face and head, be very gentle. Use a damp cloth for sensitive areas like the eyes and mouth and do not spray water in their ears.</p>
      <p>Next, shampoo their head by rubbing around their temples and ear flaps, gently massaging their snout and under the chin. Rinse thoroughly with water, being careful to keep product away from the eyes.</p>
      <p>If your dog seems relaxed, repeat the above steps with any other dog bathing products you’re using (flea treatments, conditioners etc.)</p>
      <h2 id="Step 5 Drying and styling">Step 5 Drying and styling</h2>
      <p>Now your pooch is squeaky clean, you’re ready for styling. Remove your dog from the bathtub and into a clean space with lots of towels for drying and coat trimming.</p>
      <h3 id="Drying">Drying</h3>
      <p>Start by towel drying your pooch all over - easy does it. If your pooch has a thick coat, it could be worth blow drying, or using a brush or comb to get out any tangles from bathing. Keep the hairdryer on a cool setting and don’t hold the blast close to your dog’s skin or you could bother them.</p>
      <h3 id="Trimming and styling">Trimming and styling</h3>
      <p>Get your grooming shears and/or clippers ready, as you’re now in the role of dog stylist. It’s essential that your dog is calm during this segment, so do everything possible to keep them feeling mellow - give them fuss, dispense tasty calming dog treats, and attach a lead if necessary. Take regular breaks - and it’s ok to admit defeat if your dog just won’t play ball at this point!</p>
      <h4>From the neck down</h4>
      <p>Leaving the head and face until last, start trimming/clipping fur from the neck down. Starting with the back and sides of your dog is the easiest way to get them comfortable with what’s going on. Trim in the direction of hair growth in smooth movements (don’t make any sudden jolts). Remember the chest area, and carefully trim fur on the belly as your dog stands, being aware of sensitive spots.</p>
      <h4>Paws</h4>
      <p>Be very careful with paw fur. While they’re standing, guide your dog to lift each paw one at a time, and gently trim the fur between their toe pads.</p>
      <h4>Bum</h4>
      <p>Fur around the bum can be especially sensitive to trim, but it’s very important not to miss it out. Lift the tail and trim only excess fur, without getting too close to the skin. If your pooch has a long or thick coat, the aim is not to shave the area entirely but to tidy it, shortening the fur so the bum can function (!) as it should.</p>
      <h4>Face and head</h4>
      <p>Leave the face and head until last, as this will likely cause your dog the most impatience. Holding your dog under the chin, use grooming shears to carefully shorten fur around their snout and mouth, and trim and shape their ears. Be especially careful around the eyes. It’s important that your dog can see clearly and doesn’t have bits of fur poking the eye area, but be very patient when near your dogs’ eyes with scissors.</p>
      <h3 id="Massage and spruce">Massage and spruce</h3>
      <p>When you’re done, look over your dog from different angles to be sure their new coat-cut is even, especially around the face and ears. Give your dog a soothing massage in their fresh fur, and a final calming dog treat, completing the doggy pampering session.</p>
      <p>Add cute accessories like a bow tie or hair ribbon as desired, and your prim and princely pooch is good to go.</p>
      <h2 id="Things to consider">Things to consider</h2>
      <p>Before you get into Crufts mode and grab the doggy shampoo, be sure to bear in mind the following:</p>
      <h3 id="Different dog coats">Different dog coats</h3>
      <p>Some of you may be thinking, ‘But my dog has an unusual coat?’. It’s true, grooming techniques and frequency is very dependent on what kind of coat your dog has. Your vet can give you more specifics, but here’s a quick reference guide to grooming for different coats:</p>
      <h4>Short-haired coat (such as Whippet, Beagle, Pug)</h4>
      <p>Dogs with very short or smooth coats need the least amount of grooming, but it’s still important to keep them clean. A weekly brushing session should be adequate, with regular bathing and scheduled grooming every couple of months.</p>
      <h4>Medium-haired coat (such as Cocker Spaniel, Border Collie)</h4>
      <p>Keep your medium-coated dog smooth and fresh by brushing them every few days and bathing when needed (after muddy walks, etc). Be sure to keep their coat trimmed, especially in the summer.</p>
      <h4>Long-haired coat (such as Afghan Hound, Shih Tzu)</h4>
      <p>Long-haired dogs require daily brushing to keep tangles and knots out. When it comes to grooming, conditioning and styling is important so their fur is kept out of their face and they can get around easily. Consider shortening their coat in the summer so they stay cool.</p>
      <h4>Double coated (such as Husky, German Shepherd)</h4>
      <p>Double-coated dogs require more maintenance, as they shed regularly and their coats are important to how their bodies function. Use a special undercoat comb to regularly brush them, and pick a shampoo formulated for double-coated dogs. Be sure to always dry them properly after bathing to prevent skin issues.</p>
      <h4>Curly/wavy (such as Poodle, Labradoodle)</h4>
      <p>Regular brushing is needed with curly breeds in order to avoid tangles and distribute natural oils through the fur. Owners of curly breeds often use professional groomers who are specially trained in cutting curly fur.</p>
      <h4>Wire/course (such as Schnauzer, Scottish Terrier)</h4>
      <p>Wire coated breeds require specific grooming techniques to keep the quality of their coarse fur. This sometimes involves using a handstrip or strip knife to get rid of rogue hairs, though some dog owners clip the whole coat uniformly. Chat with your vet or a professional groomer to consider options.</p>
      <h3 id="Go extra">Go extra</h3>
      <p>If your dog isn’t the most co-operative around grooming time, it could be worth going the extra mile to make it a positive experience.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Try some aromatherapy to keep the ambience pleasant and serene.</li>
        <li>Have your dog’s comfort toy on hand to distract and calm them.</li>
        <li>Calming dog treats are your best friend throughout the session, particularly ones with natural relaxants such as hemp or chamomile.</li>
        <li>Gently massage your dog throughout shampooing and styling - they’ll find this hard to pass up.</li>
        <li>Take regular breaks if your pooch seems fidgety, agitated or bored.</li>
        <li>Practise, practise, practise! It’s a skill to groom a dog successfully and patience is a virtue. Keep trying and you’ll eventually get the hang of it.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="Using a professional">Using a professional</h2>
      <p>Grooming at home saves money but it’s also a big effort, and lots of pooch parents choose to use the services of a professional groomer. This can be especially beneficial if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your dog has little patience for grooming, and so do you!</li>
        <li>Your dog gets anxiety and could benefit from someone who handles dogs professionally.</li>
        <li>Your dog has special requirements such as a curly or coarse coat.</li>
        <li>You'd like your dog to have specific treatments or fancy styling that you can’t do yourself.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="FAQs">FAQs</h2>
      <p>You should now be all set to get your dog Crufts ready! To finish, here are some final questions about grooming your dog at home.</p>
      <h3 id="Help! I’ve clipped my dog’s nail too short and it’s bleeding">Help! I’ve clipped my dog’s nail too short and it’s bleeding</h3>
      <p>Clipping a dog’s nails at home can be nerve-wracking and accidents can happen. If you’ve trimmed the nail back too far and hit the ‘quick’ (blood vessels and nerve endings within the claw), your dog’s nail might bleed.</p>
      <p>Stay calm (your dog will pick up on your distress if you panic), dip the nail in some styptic powder (an anti-hemorrhagic agent that stops light wounds from bleeding) and apply a cotton swab. These things happen and the snip will usually heal relatively quickly. If your dog seems in pain and it continues to bleed, get in touch with your vet.</p>
      <h3 id="How often should I groom my dog?">How often should I groom my dog?</h3>
      <p>Grooming needs to be a regular part of your dog’s schedule. It depends on your dog’s particular coat and how often they get dirty (!) but in general, a full groom every four to six weeks is recommended.</p>
      <p>Your dog may need grooming more often in the summer, especially if they have a long coat that makes them overly hot. Small grooming tasks can be done much more regularly - for instance, brushing your dog, bathing them after muddy walks, or cleaning their eyes and ears.</p>
      <h3 id="My dog is too anxious to groom?">My dog is too anxious to groom?</h3>
      <p>It can be very frustrating trying to groom a difficult dog. Keeping a calm space, as well as grounding them with calming dog treats, praise and affection will give them a sense of safety. Also, the more regularly they’re groomed, the more they will get used to the process and hopefully become more mellow with time.</p>
      <p>However, if your dog simply won’t let you groom them - if they snap or go into attack mode, or they seem distressed by the whole ordeal - consider going to a professional groomer or behavioural therapist instead. Your vet can give some recommendations on what to do next so your dog can be clean and coiffed, but happy, too.</p>

<p>With us treating our fur babies more like human babies every day, it's only fair we get them involved in the TASTIEST day of the year... Pancake Day!</p>
      <p>With so many lip-smacking options out there, it's important that we lovingly create something for our pooches that's safe for their sensitive tums.</p>
      <p>Let us do the hard work for you, we have some great ideas:</p>
      <h2 id="Dog-friendly banana pancakes">Dog-friendly banana pancakes</h2>
      <p>Let's begin with the pancake itself. A great base recipe for pooch-friendly pancakes is a simple one:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One ripe and sweet banana</li>
        <li>One egg (shell can be included if you like)</li>
        <li>100g of plain flour*</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><strong>*As flour is usually made from wheat, use an alternative if your dog's intolerant or allergic to grains. Good options include coconut flour or almond flour.</strong></h2>
      <h3 id="Recipe step-by-step">Recipe step-by-step</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Mash the ripened banana with a fork until it's a smooth consistency</li>
        <li>Add the egg and flour, beating until a smooth batter's formed</li>
        <li>The batter can then be fried like a classic pancake or used in a waffle maker.</li>
        <li>If frying, use a small amount of coconut or olive oil. Oil spray is a great option, as only a few drops are needed to grease the pan and prevent sticking - making it a healthier way to cook for your pooch</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="Time for toppings - Sweet vs Savoury">Time for toppings - Sweet vs Savoury</h2>
      <p>Whether your pooch has a sweet, savoury or "give me anything!" type of palate, there's loads of dog-friendly ingredients you can use as toppings to make your pancakes extra appetising, including:</p>
      <div>Sweet Savoury
Peanut butter (xylitol free) Spinach
Honey Carrot
Berries Broccoli
Mango Peas
Apple Cheese
Peach</div>
      <h2 id="Pooch and Mutt toppings and fillers">Pooch and Mutt toppings and fillers</h2>
      <p>Of course, our Pooch menu is brimming with amazing flavours and treats that would be the ideal addition to pooch pancakes this Pancake Day.</p>
      <h2><strong>Toppings</strong></h2>
      <p>Meaty Treats Taster Pack</p>
      <p>High Protein Beef Jerky</p>
      <p>Love-ly Lamb Meaty Treats</p>
      <p>Hemp Chewies</p>
      <h2><strong>Fillers</strong></h2>
      <p>Salmon Oil</p>
      <p>Bionic Biotic</p>
      <p>Mobile Bones</p>
      <h2 id="Pancake ingredients that arent dog-friendly">Pancake ingredients that arent dog-friendly</h2>
      <p>There are some definite no-nos when it comes to pancake toppings and our dogs. These include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Toxins like raisins, grapes , chocolate and macadamia nuts</li>
        <li>Dairy cream. Most adult dogs are lactose intolerant and dairy can cause a stomach upset</li>
        <li>Sugar or syrup. While a sweet treat for us, it has no real nutritional value and can contribute to weight gain</li>
        <li>Lemon or lime. These citrus fruits are not well tolerated by dogs and their juice isn't easily digested</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="Top tips for feeding time">Top tips for feeding time</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>When it's time to serve up, make sure you allow the pancakes to cool to room temperature first. Otherwise, the smell may be so tempting that your dog chomps it down before giving it time to cool, which could burn their mouth or even lead to oral ulcers.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure your dog doesn’t overindulge. A small dog should only get a few bites of pancake, while a giant breed would be able to eat a whole pancake with ease.

<p>For many of us, Christmas and the winter season are teeming with parties and family gatherings. Dogs aren’t the most relaxed when it comes to noisy visitors in their space - even if they’re excited, they can still be a handful!</p>
      <p>There’s no need to call off the festive bash just because your pooch is particularly hyper; with a few extra preparatory steps, you can throw a party that is fun for both your guests and your four-legged companions.</p>
      <p>Read on for our full guide to hosting a pet safe party. We've covered tips for before, during and after the celebration, so that parties aren’t stressful for you or your pooch.</p>
      <h2 id="Before the party…">Before the party…</h2>
      <p>It’s time to party-plan! Be it a big blowout or a cosy gathering with crisps and dips, hosting a bash that won’t upset your pooch is all about preparation, so that both your guests and dog are well equipped to enjoy each other’s company.</p>
      <h2><strong>Tell guests about your dog</strong></h2>
      <p>People have different ideas over what a party entails, so let your guests know what the vibe will be, and that your dog will be home at the time. With this news, they’ll know to adjust their behaviour for the presence of a cute pooch. If any of your guests have allergies to pets, this also avoids any awkward introductions/sneezing fits on arrival.</p>
      <p>Before the party (as well as in person on the day), give a short summary of what your dog is like, what rules you have in place for your pooch (no jumping on sofa, for example) and kindly ask your guests not to overwhelm your dog.</p>
      <p>Set boundaries for feeding</p>
      <p>Rules for feeding your dog should also be laid out before the party. If not, on the day your guests might impulsively share food after receiving those irresistible puppy dog eyes, especially if drinks are flowing.</p>
      <p>To avoid having to do damage control when the party is ongoing, tell everyone in advance not to sneak the dog any human food - and give good reasons why this is. If people know that your dog can’t digest certain foods or could become really ill, we’re sure they won’t be tempted to break the rules on the day of the party.</p>
      <p>Then again, it’s nice to give the dog something, so stock up on treats or dog biscuits that are suitable (some healthy meaty dog treats, for instance, or healthy Christmas treats for dogs), so that your guests, and pooch are somewhat satisfied!</p>
      <p>Create a calm space for your dog</p>
      <p>Depending on your dog’s personality, they could be super excited around all your friends and family in a party environment; or feel on edge that their home is being invaded. Even a dog who loves visitors might need a moment to regain a sense of calm after all that socialising - even we humans know the feeling! For this reason, arrange a ‘safe space’ that’s just for your dog to keep them stabilised throughout the party.</p>
      <p>For instance, you could place their dog bed in a clean, quiet room, have dimmed, serene lighting and soft scents, with a long-lasting dog chew and their favourite toys nearby. If you usually use crate training, you should put your dog’s crate somewhere quiet and away from guests so they can retreat for some relaxation if necessary. Be sure to show them where this safe space is beforehand, especially if you’ve moved their bed or crate for the party.</p>
      <h2><strong>Consider a dog sitter</strong></h2>
      <p>If you’re not sure your dog would respond well to the sensory stimulation of a party, play it safe and arrange a dog sitter for the evening. If your dog can’t relax then neither will you, and a party should be fun for everyone - even the host!</p>
      <h2 id="The day of the party…">The day of the party…</h2>
      <p>Party day is here - and your dog’s behaviour will be greatly affected by what kind of day they have. Follow the below tips to lead them towards a calm, happy and visitor-friendly mood.</p>
      <h2><strong>Stick to your dog’s regular routine</strong></h2>
      <p>On the day of the party, be sure your pooch has had a calm, structured day with regular meals and a good walk to tire them out. Exercise releases soothing endorphins for dogs, and sticking to their regular routine should have them in a cordial, laid-back mood for when guests start to arrive.</p>
      <h2><strong>Clear away potential hazards</strong></h2>
      <p>It’ll be impossible to keep track of what your dog’s up to when you’re busy entertaining. So why not ask your guests to help watch over your dog, but make life easier ahead of time by getting rid of any obvious hazards in the house. Some examples could be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hiding plants, ornaments or other decor that could be broken or knocked over</li>
        <li>Getting paper or plastic cups to avoid the risk of glasses or dishes breaking, and shards injuring your pooch’s feet</li>
        <li>No chocolate or other gifts toxic to your pooch should be displayed within their reach</li>
        <li>Any musical or flashing ornaments that trigger your dog (a singing Santa, for instance) should be put away</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><strong>Try calming food and treats</strong></h2>
      <p>For an added safety measure, your pooch might enjoy calming dog food or treats during the build-up and on the day, with serotonin-boosting ingredients having them feeling their most relaxed. Try a few calming dog treats (e.g. Pooch & Mutt Probiotic Calming Treats contain turkey and hemp as natural mood-enhancers), or a bowl of tasty calming dog food for their lunch. This is an especially good tip if your dog has a tendency to be hyper around visitors.</p>
      <h2 id="During the party…">During the party…</h2>
      <p>There will be a lot going on while the party’s in full swing! Pay attention to the following steps throughout the event to ensure your dog stays cool as a cucumber.</p>
      <h2><strong>Remember dog treats</strong></h2>
      <p>As your guests start arriving, remember to slip your dog a few calming dog treats. Not only will they feel content at being given a treat, the naturally soothing ingredients will relax them. Keep some regular dog treats available, too, in case your guests want to spoil your dog (they’ll enjoy this kind of attention).</p>
      <h2><strong>Stay in control</strong></h2>
      <p>If your dog jumps up at guests or barks a lot, be authoritative in your directions. Your pooch needs to know that this is an event where they must behave, and they will feel safer knowing that you are in control.</p>
      <h2><strong>Keep human food out of reach</strong></h2>
      <p>Eating fatty, sugary foods will wreak havoc with your dog’s digestion and mood. Remind guests to keep food out of the way of hungry snouts - don’t leave plates of leftovers on the floor and have a designated space to put dirty dishes. Maybe appoint one or two friends to help you clean food away as it’s finished with, or else your pooch will soon be hoovering it up!</p>
      <h2><strong>Have a safe way for your dog to go outside</strong></h2>
      <p>As well as the safe space you’ve arranged for your dog, allow them to go outside intermittently; perhaps into a secured back garden so they can get some air and space. Don’t let guests take your dog outside without asking, and be sure there’s no way for them to escape (doors left open should be a no-no). Also ensure your dog’s been microchipped and is wearing an ID collar (it’s the law, as well as the easiest way to locate missing pets!).</p>
      <h2><strong>Check on your dog regularly</strong></h2>
      <p>You’ll be easily distracted at your own party, so be sure to check in your pooch whenever you can - show them some attention and affection and ask some trusted guests to do the same (if they’re not already!). If your dog seems nervous at any time, remember to show them to their safe space so they know they can take some time out.</p>
      <h2><strong>Ask guests to keep it down</strong></h2>
      <p>You can’t entirely control the decibel level at a party, but if things are getting rowdier than your dog can handle, or the music is a bit loud, don’t feel afraid to ask guests to keep it down. This is especially true if your dog is getting distressed and their safe space isn’t feeling all that calm due to the noise in the other room.</p>
      <h2 id="After the party…">After the party…</h2>
      <p>The party’s over, but you’re not done pet-proofing…</p>
      <h2><strong>Dispose of rubbish quickly&nbsp;</strong></h2>
      <p>Dirty dishes, leftover food and possessions left behind are all fair game for a nosy dog. Do a superficial clean-up as soon as guests leave to clear away any post-party hazards - anything your pooch might get their nose into should be swept away out of their reach. The next morning, be sure you’re up as your dog is, ready to clean up properly and get the house back to normal.</p>
      <h2><strong>Take your dog for a walk</strong></h2>
      <p>Your dog likely needs some air and exercise to recalibrate after the festivities. Whether you take them for a short walk right after guests have left, or a longer one in the morning, it’ll do your pooch’s mood the world of good to get straight back into routine.</p>
      <h2><strong>Keep an eye on your dog’s behaviour</strong></h2>
      <p>Hopefully your dog has taken the party in their stride, but keep an eye on them for any unusual behaviour. If they seem lethargic, nervous, unhappy or have a dodgy tummy, it could be that the party has stressed them somewhat, or they ate something that doesn’t agree with them. If this continues, get them to a vet for a quick check up.</p>
      <h2><strong>Assess whether your dog and parties can mix</strong></h2>
      <p>With the right preparatory steps, your dog might handle a party just fine! If they seemed on edge throughout the night, however, or had a sort of ‘doggy hangover’ after all that socialising and stimulation, you might want to get a dog sitter for any future shindigs. It’s up to you to make that call.</p>
      <p>Are you all set to plan that party? Stock up on healthy treats for your dog, including calming dog treats with natural relaxants, to have them cool and collected for Christmas fun and festivities - without the digestive hangover.</p>

<p>Christmas is a big deal, with a lot of sensory distractions - especially if you walk around on all fours and are only one-to-three feet tall. For our canine best friends, the sudden onset of sparkly decorations, piles of gifts, lots of noisy visitors and persistent new food smells can be very overwhelming. It’s understandable that your pooch may be a little harder to control at this time of year, and you might worry about their wellbeing.</p>
      <p>Keeping your dog at their safest and calmest over the festive season is all down to simple preparation. By adding a few extra dog-proofing steps to your Christmas routine - from safely decorating your Christmas tree to making sure your dog is occupied at dinnertime - your pooch, and you in turn, can enjoy this hectic season more peacefully.</p>
      <p>Read on for our top tips for dog-proofing your house over Christmas…</p>
      <h2 id="Dog-proofing your Christmas tree">Dog-proofing your Christmas tree</h2>
      <p>First up: the tree. You might not consider your dog’s relationship with your Christmas tree until they come ‘fur to fir’ with each other in a stand off - then the questions will arise. “Do dogs like Christmas trees?”, “Will a real Christmas tree poison the dog?!” and “Are fake Christmas trees toxic to dogs?”.</p>
      <p>Here are some dog-proof Christmas tree ideas to have pooch and tree living in harmony together until January.</p>
      <h3 id="What type of Christmas tree is the safest for dogs?">What type of Christmas tree is the safest for dogs?</h3>
      <p>In general, dogs and Christmas trees should be kept a safe distance from each other, as whether it’s a natural or artificial tree you go for, there are various hazards.</p>
      <h4>A real tree</h4>
      <p>For some families, it’s hard to imagine going without a real tree. Luckily, the trees most often used at Christmas (fir, pine, spruce) are non-toxic to dogs, so it won’t be too much of an emergency if they have a curious chew. What could cause irritation or a tummy upset however, are the dropping pine needles or tree sap.</p>
      <p>For this reason, even though real Christmas trees are generally safe to dogs, it’s a good idea to clean up the needles regularly, always supervise your pooch around the tree, and keep them apart with a gate or tree barrier.</p>
      <h4>An artificial tree</h4>
      <p>What about a fake tree? Artificial trees are usually made of plastic, but dogs still may chew on them and cause harm to themselves and the tree itself. Some artificial trees also come with a frosting of fake snow, which can be toxic to dogs. Again, it’s best to be safe and keep a barrier between your tree and the dog(s) in your home to avoid any ingestion which could lead to stomach upsets or blockages.</p>
      <h3 id="Use a Christmas tree guard">Use a Christmas tree guard</h3>
      <p>Pets getting at the Christmas tree is an age-old problem (we all know that cats love to climb), so tree barriers are widely available. This is to protect your dog from your Christmas tree, and vice versa. Though Christmas tree guards for dogs are a great solution, do supervise your dog around the tree anyway, and don’t leave them in the same room when you go out.</p>
      <h3 id="Go bare">Go bare</h3>
      <p>When you first get out your Christmas tree, your dog may be very aware of its big, imposing and unfamiliar presence. Rather than intensify the strangeness by immediately hanging lights and sparkly objects from the tree, leave it bare for a few days. This gives your pooch time to get used to the change in environment, and will mean the transition to decorated tree will be less disruptive for them.</p>
      <h3 id="Dog-friendly decorating">Dog-friendly decorating</h3>
      <p>When it comes to decorating, some pooch parents keep the bottom of the tree bare and only hang things on higher branches - or you can even get half trees for dogs that stay out of reach of paws, claws and gnashers.</p>
      <p>If you want to decorate the whole tree, avoid edible decorations like popcorn strings and chocolate baubles - they will simply be too tempting for a dog. Delicate baubles that may smash should also be avoided or hung elsewhere, and real garlands (ivy or holly, for instance) should also be draped higher up, not in dog’s reach. This is especially true when it comes to puppies and Christmas trees - at this age, they are prone to destruction!</p>
      <h3 id="Distracting your dog from the Christmas tree">Distracting your dog from the Christmas tree</h3>
      <p>It can help to have distractions around so that you can train your dog to stay away from the tree. A special Christmas-themed toy could help - that you get out at particular times of day when your dog seems their most troublesome. Festive treats for dogs can also be used as a good training tool.</p>
      <h3 id="Keeping gifts under the tree">Keeping gifts under the tree</h3>
      <p>Piles of gifts are another evil temptation for a dog - most pooches know what gift wrapping is by a certain age and will be desperate to tear the boxes open. To save any tears or ruined surprises, it’s a good idea to keep gifts hidden away until Christmas morning. If this isn’t possible, at least keep them behind a barrier or gate.</p>
      <p>Remember, you can keep dogs away from everyone’s gifts on Christmas day by giving them their own gifts to unwrap, like a Christmas hamper for dogs.</p>
      <h2 id="Christmas decorations that are unsafe for dogs">Christmas decorations that are unsafe for dogs</h2>
      <p>You can keep fancy decorations out of reach of your pooch, but there are some items that are particularly unsafe.</p>
      <h3 id="No open flames">No open flames</h3>
      <p>Don’t keep any open flames where a pet could brush it or knock it over, such as Christmas candle displays or intricate light set-ups.</p>
      <h3 id="Electrical cords">Electrical cords</h3>
      <p>Has your cheeky dog chewed the Christmas lights? More decorative lights means an abundance of electrical cords which dogs are often tempted to nibble. Keep an excess of cords neat, hidden or behind gates and barriers - as a safety precaution to your entire family as well as pets.</p>
      <h3 id="Edible decorations">Edible decorations</h3>
      <p>As mentioned, chocolate baubles or candy strings are too tempting for pets to have hanging around. If you have edible decorations, keep them out of sight (and smell!) of your dog, or perhaps bring them out purposefully at the time your family will eat them.</p>
      <h2 id="Keep your dog safe from festive plants">Keep your dog safe from festive plants</h2>
      <p>Christmas is the perfect time to adorn your rooms with festive foliage - holly, ivy, mistletoe - while still making sure they’re safe enough to be around a curious pooch. Though most Christmas plants are moderately safe and will only cause mild stomach upset, certain parts of plants (holly or mistletoe berries, for example) can be dangerous to dogs if munched in large amounts.</p>
      <p>So long as you supervise your dog around Christmas plants, hang them well out of reach and deter your pooch from eating any should they try it, they should be fine. So that you’re in the know about which plants are safest, here’s a rundown of which Christmas plants are toxic to dogs.</p>
      <p>If you’re uncertain about whether you can trust your dog around festive plants, it’s best to be on the safe side and go without.</p>
      <h2 id="Keeping your dog away from the dinner table at Christmas">Keeping your dog away from the dinner table at Christmas</h2>
      <p>We tend to eat and eat at Christmas time - and our dogs will get FOMO. With so many delicious aromas and a sense of occasion around the dinner table, your pooch will make it known that they want to be involved.</p>
      <p>Here’s how to keep your dog occupied so you can enjoy your festive meal in peace.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If your dog usually has a spot they stay in at dinnertime, keep to routine. Changing it up now might just confuse them, and they’re more likely to behave themselves if they stick to what they know.</li>
        <li>If they’re disruptive while you’re eating, you could have your dog eat their meal in a different room so that you can enjoy dinner without interruption. If they’re calmer in the same room as you, try serving them their meal in a corner, and comfort them with toys or a treat.</li>
        <li>Serve your pooch a special Christmas meal for dogs, don’t just scrape your leftovers into their bowl as it’s likely too fatty and sugary for them. Giving them the right food will ensure they won’t feel lethargic and have a tummy upset come the evening (even if you do!). Here’s a list of which Christmas foods dogs can safely eat.</li>
        <li>Tell your guests not to sneak any table scraps to your pooch - even when your dog is begging and being very cute.</li>
        <li>Walk them just before. For maximum likelihood that your dog will chill out for a while during dinner, take them for an extra walk before you eat.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="My dog gets excitable at Christmas - what do I do?">My dog gets excitable at Christmas - what do I do?</h2>
      <p>It makes sense that your dog might be a bit on edge at Christmas - it’s an exciting yet overstimulating time for most of us. By introducing new things slowly, reassuring your dog and keeping to a regular routine, they should handle the festive season relatively smoothly. Read on for some tips to keep your dog calm over Christmas.</p>
      <h2 id="How to calm your dog down at Christmas">How to calm your dog down at Christmas</h2>
      <p>For a dog as cool as a Christmas cucumber -</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep to their regular routine</li>
        <li>Reassure your pooch during overstimulating events</li>
        <li>Occupy your dog with a few smartly dispensed, calming dog treats</li>
        <li>Ensure your dog has a peaceful, quiet space to retreat to when necessary.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="Lots of visitors">Lots of visitors</h3>
      <p>Having more people in the house than usual can send your dog into overdrive. Be sure to take them into a calm, empty space if they need a moment, or distract them with toys and calming dog food.</p>
      <h3 id="Santa outfits">Santa outfits</h3>
      <p>Dogs won’t always know that Santa is likely a family member dressed up - be ready to pull off a beard if necessary so your dog knows they needn’t be on guard!</p>
      <h3 id="Flashing lights and noisy environment">Flashing lights and noisy environment</h3>
      <p>Some decorations are too noisy or flashy for certain dogs to deal with - for instance, a singing Santa figure could trigger a frightened barking fit. If this is the case, you might want to only set off these decorations for visitors when the dog is in another room, or switch them off most of the time if it causes too much stress to your pooch.</p>
      <h3 id="Opening gifts">Opening gifts</h3>
      <p>Giving your dog some calming dog treats or letting them unwrap their own Christmas gift for dogs will be a great distraction for your pooch during gift-giving time. This way your dog can feel they’re included without disrupting the fun.</p>
      <h3 id="During Christmas dinner">During Christmas dinner</h3>
      <p>To avoid your dog feeling left out, be sure your dog gets a special meal like the rest of the family by dishing up a doggy Christmas dinner when you’re eating. Keep to your regular meal-time routine and maybe give them a calming dog treat or two so they know to behave.</p>
      <h3 id="Fireworks">Fireworks</h3>
      <p>Fireworks aren’t exactly dogs’ best friends, and they’re likely to go off at random periods throughout Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Consider some calming dog food, supervise and comfort them, and of course, keep them indoors during firework displays.</p>
      <h3 id="Leaving your dog alone">Leaving your dog alone</h3>
      <p>If you have to leave your dog alone for a short time over the Christmas period, be sure they have the safety of their regular blankets, crate or den, comforting toys and perhaps some gentle dog music. Use a baby gate or dog barriers to be sure they stay in rooms away from hazardous Christmas decorations or plants, and don’t stay out for hours, if possible.</p>
      <p>In summary…</p>
      <p>There’s a lot to manage at Christmas, but so long as you set boundaries for your pooch (physical as well as behavioural) while making efforts to involve them in activities and offer doggy-safe spaces, they should stay happy and calm over the festive season. Keep hazards out of reach, feed them healthy festive dog food that sits well with their tums, and reassure them with their own toys and gifts so they can join in with the family fun over Christmas.</p>

<p>Owning a pooch is a big responsibility. Their health, nutrition, walkies and playtime is all in your capable hands - oh, and keeping them looking absolutely adorable of course.</p>
      <p>When you think about how they’re looking on the outside, the first thing that probably comes to mind is what pooch-iful outfit you can adorn them in. But before you go ahead filling their wardrobe with statement pieces, it’s really important you consider how they feel when wearing them.</p>
      <p>Their safety and wellbeing must always come first, so we’re here to help you spot the signs of whether your pooch is happy or not.</p>
      <h2 id="Different types of dog clothes">Different types of dog clothes</h2>
      <p>There’s a big difference between dressing your dog up for vanity, and necessity.</p>
      <p>We’re not saying it’s wrong to want to dress them up in those cute fancy-dress outfits - but you may need to reconsider pursuing it if they’re visibly distressed.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if it’s freezing cold outside and you have a small, short-haired breed who hates wearing warm clothes (but it’s in their best interest to) - this is where building up their confidence to do so is important.</p>
      <p>Simply put, it’s up to you as a dog owner to make the right choice for them, based on what you see and know.</p>
      <h2 id="How to safely dress your dog in clothes">How to safely dress your dog in clothes</h2>
      <p>So, you’ve got their fancy-dress outfit/jumper/coat/whatever-else-you-want-to-dress-them-in at the ready.</p>
      <p>You need to make them feel as comfortable as possible, and work through the below steps slowly:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have the clothing out and visible for them to investigate BEFORE you try putting them on. Allow them to have a good sniff and familarise themselves with the item</li>
        <li>Get them to come over to you. Invading their safe space to put clothes on could cause negative association</li>
        <li>Once they’ve come over, use optimistic and reassuring language, feed them some Pooch and Mutt treats for positive association, and let them sniff the clothing again</li>
        <li>Very slowly, start to put the clothing on them. Continue using positive language, and consider the most comfortable way to get them into it</li>
        <li>Squeezing them into something that’s too tight, bending them into unnatural positions, or noticing that they’re distressed isn’t ‘comfortable’ - so you should stop straight away</li>
        <li>If they seem happy and have allowed you to put them into the outfit, then reward them with a tasty Pooch & Mutt treat so they know the ‘task’ is complete and positive associations with wearing the clothes can be made</li>
        <li>If your pooch hasn't worn anything before, they might need time to get used to the item and build-up their time wearing it again. Don't worry if you need to take a break, and come back to it another time to try again.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>At this point, you need to closely watch their behaviour and check for any signs of discomfort or distress.</p>
      <h2 id="Signs that your dog doesn’t like wearing clothes">Signs that your dog doesn’t like wearing clothes</h2>
      <p>If your dog doesn’t like wearing their clothes - you might not be able to tell immediately. Keep a close watch on your pooch to spot any signs of upset. These are some of the things to look out for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Being vocal, restless and attempting to take the outfit off</li>
        <li>Looking tense and not moving</li>
        <li>Their tail is tucked, ears are flat and they’re turning their head away</li>
        <li>Excessively licking their lips or yawning - these are called ‘calming signals’</li>
        <li>Showing signs of aggression and frustration</li>
        <li>Panting (which could show they're stressed and/or hot)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You know your fur baby better than anyone - so you’re likely to be able to tell pretty quickly if they’re not happy. If you notice any of the above, you should take their clothes off straight away.</p>
      <h2 id="How do I make my dog feel happier wearing clothes?">How do I make my dog feel happier wearing clothes?</h2>
      <p>If you need to get them into clothes for their health and wellbeing (e.g. they’ve had an operation and need to wear a vest, it’s cold outside which could cause illness etc.) then it might be worth trying again.</p>
      <p>Here are some top tips:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Leave some time between your last attempt so they don’t feel overwhelmed</li>
        <li>Try at a different time of day when they might be feeling a little more relaxed</li>
        <li>Feed food and treats from our Calming Range during the lead up to them wearing their clothes. The ingredients in these products can naturally and safely help them feel calmer</li>
        <li>Don’t force it. The last thing you want is for them to keep having a bad experience. If you’ve tried a few times without success, then maybe speak to your vet for advice</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="Alternatives to fashion clothes for dogs">Alternatives to fashion clothes for dogs</h2>
      <p>If clothes just aren’t your pooch’s forte, but you’re looking to create some cute pet content for Instagram - there are plenty of other things you can do!</p>
      <p>You could use props and create a seasonal scene for your dog to pose amongst, use a social ‘filter’ so you can visualise how they’d look in the real thing, or dress them in accessories (which are much less obtrusive) - such as a bandana, decorative harness, collar, collar charm, or bow tie.</p>

<p>Pooches everywhere have problems with anxiety - they are, after all, extremely in-tune with their emotions and very easily pick up on changes in their environment.</p>
      <p>There are some scenarios when a dog’s anxiety intensifies, however - and one of the most common triggers is bedtime. When a dog senses it’s time to sleep, they may get ‘zoomies’, become hard to control or behave in a somewhat agitated manner, leaving you wondering, ‘Is this how it has to be every night?’</p>
      <p>Never fear - because no matter how bedtime-averse your pooch is, we’ve got some great techniques for improving their sleep routine, eventually easing your dog into bed every night without struggle or panic. Read on to learn some smart tips and tricks to settle a dog at night.</p>
      <h2 id="How to settle a dog at night">How to settle a dog at night</h2>
      <p>The moon is up, everyone’s wound down from a busy day, and it’s time for your pooch to hit their basket, den or wherever they tend to feel most rested. However, your dog has other ideas - and could be particularly excitable, jumpy or defiant.</p>
      <p>There could be bigger problems at play, but it’s likely this bedtime issue can be remedied with a few simple changes. Consider the following bedtime techniques for dogs, and hopefully they’ll be catching zeds more readily in no time:</p>
      <h3 id="Spend time with your dog before bedtime">Spend time with your dog before bedtime</h3>
      <p>Even humans sometimes feel cheated out of a good day when the bedtime hour comes round - “What, already?” - and it seems dogs can feel the exact same way.</p>
      <p>To ensure your pooch feels rested and satisfied once it’s time to sleep, spend some quality time with them in the hours beforehand. This could be cuddling, playing with toys or just sitting with them for a nice head scratch. The mental stimulation should exert their energy just enough to have them all tuckered out for bed. Time spent together can also be a great option if your pooch suffers from separation anxiety at night, as they’ll feel safe and secure in your close proximity.</p>
      <h3 id="Go for extra walkies before bed">Go for extra walkies before bed</h3>
      <p>There’s nothing like physical exertion to release those powerful sleeping endorphins, so try heading out for an extra walk with your dog in the evenings. Your pooch will likely love the outdoor time and the extra stimulation should wear them out within minutes of getting home, ready for a good night’s sleep. A bonus point - it should tire you out, too!</p>
      <h3 id="Give your dog a calming treat">Give your dog a calming treat</h3>
      <p>Some tasty dog calming treats could be the ticket if your pooch has a habit of getting angsty before bed. Treats to calm your dog generally contain naturally soothing ingredients, such as chamomile, hemp or valerian root - giving them a boost of relaxation that should lull them into sleep mode. Treats can come as supplements, or calming dental sticks, meaning there are plenty of ways to try and engage their appetite.</p>
      <h3 id="Provide them a secure comfy place to sleep">Provide them a secure comfy place to sleep</h3>
      <p>A healthy sleep environment is key to a deep, restful sleep - and that applies to dogs just as much as humans. If your pooch doesn’t have their own sleep spot, this is an essential - whether it be a comfy basket, blanket, dog house or cool, dark room they like to retreat to. It should be cool, dry and quiet in their sleep spot, with no chance of sudden interruptions or lights causing them to feel nervous.</p>
      <h3 id="Crate train your dog">Crate train your dog</h3>
      <p>Though it’s easier to crate train a puppy, you can still crate train a dog at any age to improve symptoms of anxiety and unease. Dogs are naturally drawn to being in a den-like environment, so a crate should instil in them a sense of safety and security. Get in touch with your vet or a behavioural expert about gradually introducing crate training into your pooch’s night-time routine, and as they begin to associate the crate with sleep, it could significantly improve your bedtimes.</p>
      <p>If you’re wondering how to calm a puppy down at night, they are more susceptible to crate-training, so this could work wonders for their night time over-excitement.</p>
      <h3 id="Use cuddly toys or comforters">Use cuddly toys or comforters</h3>
      <p>Dogs are much like children when it comes to feeling safe and comfortable, so be sure they have many self-soothers available, such as familiar blankets, favourite cuddly toys and comforters to snuggle up to. Sometimes it helps to have a dog toy you only bring out at bedtime, so when it appears, your pooch knows it’s time to be calm and settle down for the night. You can even get cuddly toys with a ‘heartbeat’ inside. The sound and subtle pumping motion of the heartbeat helps them feel like they’re snuggled up to their favourite hooman, or pooch mama from the puppy days.</p>
      <h3 id="Use calming scents and sounds">Use calming scents and sounds</h3>
      <p>Like cuddly toys and comforters, familiar smells that indicate bedtime can be a good way to get a dog into sleep mode. Some pooch parents use air diffusers or a room spray that emanate special dog-soothing pheromones (a subtle lavender or soft ‘night time’ scent), while others find putting on some soft, unobtrusive music in their dog’s sleeping area helps. On the other hand, just making sure there are no sounds at all in your dog’s sleep space is another fail-safe route.</p>
      <h3 id="Rule out anything health related">Rule out anything health related</h3>
      <p>If your dog is usually trouble-free at bedtime, but suddenly behaves differently when it’s time to sleep, this could be an indicator of a health issue. Keep note of your dog’s changed behaviour, along with any other symptoms such as diarrhoea, a suppressed appetite or increased anxiety, and take them to the vet for a check-up.</p>
      <h2 id="When to seek help from a professional">When to seek help from a professional</h2>
      <p>If, after trying all the above techniques, your pooch is still suffering from agitated nerves every bedtime, it could be worth seeking the help of a professional. This especially applies if your dog experiences severe anxiety at other times of the day, or generally struggles to get by day-to-day without feeling high levels of stress.</p>
      <p>With some professional input, your dog could relearn some old behaviours that will significantly improve their quality of life, and hopefully improve bedtimes for the whole family.</p>
      <p>What your dog eats each day has a huge impact on their mood and behaviour. If you’re thinking “What can I give my dog for anxiety?” and are on the lookout for some tasty calming feeds, try some of the products from our Calming Range.</p>

<p>Bringing a new pitter-patter of tiny human feet into the family is a time for celebration! A new addition to the household and another little being to love and care for is beyond exciting.</p>
      <p>But when you have a fur baby in the house too, there’s plenty of preparation that needs to be done to keep everybody happy, and most importantly, safe. Here we talk you through the prep, introducing the two to one-another, and different signs of pooch behaviour to watch-out for.</p>
      <h2 id="Before the baby arrives">Before the baby arrives</h2>
      <p>Implementing prep with your pooch, before the bambino arrives is key to a successful meet. There’s a few important things you can do to make your dog feel as comfortable as possible, taking them on the pre-baby journey with you.</p>
      <h2><strong>1. Make them part of the pregnancy</strong></h2>
      <p>Pooches are intellectual and very intuitive, so they’ll absolutely notice changes to your body. They’ll pick up on the scent of your changing hormones, your belly growing, and may even feel the baby moving if they’re close-by. All dogs react differently to this - some may become clingy, while others might get territorial.</p>
      <p>Whichever way they react, it’s important to find the balance between making them feel part of the pregnancy (pushing them out could cause problems long-term), while bringing-in some ground-rules. This leads us nicely onto our next point…</p>
      <span>2. Put in the training</span>
      <p>Extra training is usually needed in preparation for the baby arriving.  It’s really important they know and understand the basic commands of “no”, “stay” and “leave”. If these need to be used when baby’s brought home, they’ll know exactly what they need to do!</p>
      <p>Teaching ahead of time is a good way to familarise them with the commands - as introducing them when the baby’s around might make them jealous. Another good idea is to set-up the nursery a few months in advance, teach your doggo rules around keeping away from that room unless they’re invited, and to not touch the baby's things.</p>
      <span>3. Gradually make changes to their routine</span>
      <p>If your pooch is used to all the attention and a routine that revolves around them, they’ll be in for a shock when the baby arrives! As we know, dogs LOVE a routine, so they won’t take too well to this suddenly changing.</p>
      <p>Instead of waiting until the baby’s with you, gradually ease them into any changes. Start to walk them at times you think will work with your baby, along with the pram. This will teach them to not be afraid of the new object coming on walkies with them - and you can set boundaries around not pulling and walking nicely.</p>
      <p>You can also feed your pooch in a new room if this will be your plan, or give them more garden play if that’s what you imagine you’ll be doing more of.</p>
      <strong>4. Get them used to new sounds and smells</strong>
      <p>Crying, breast pump noises, baby lotions and potions - these are just some of the new sounds and smells your dog will need to get used to. Playing crying baby sounds, running the breast pump, and using some of the baby’s new toiletries leading up to the birth will familarise them with what’s to come, so it doesn’t all feel so new and scary when it happens.</p>
      <h2 id="How to introduce your new baby to your dog">How to introduce your new baby to your dog</h2>
      <p>So, the prep-work is done. The next step is introducing the pooch to your new human. You might feel nervous, but the key here is to build up the introduction really slowly…</p>
      <strong>1. Allow them to get a scent before meeting</strong>
      <p>Once your baby’s arrived, try to get a blanket or piece of clothing that has their scent on at home with your dog. A dog’s sense of smell is how they investigate - so being able to sniff out the little one’s scent before an introduction may be just what they need. This way, they’ll be slightly less inquisitive when the baby comes home, which should put your mind at ease.</p>
      <strong>2. Plenty of exercise!</strong>
      <p>A tired pooch is usually a less boisterous one - so with this in mind, a good walk before introductions is vital. Ask a family member or friend if they’re able to help the pooch release some energy just before meeting the baby.</p>
      <strong>3. Keep your dog on a leash</strong>
      <p>Dogs are inquisitive souls, so they’ll want to run straight over to the new addition to introduce themselves… and see who this new thing is! Keep the meet-and-greet under control by putting them on a leash.</p>
      <p>It’s a good idea to have the initial meet in a neutral spot like the front garden; let your baby enter the house first, followed by the pooch. This will help stop them getting territorial, and help them understand that the baby is part of the household.</p>
      <strong>4. Let them sniff from a distance</strong>
      <p>They’ll probably want to smell the new addition until their heart’s content, but the best thing is to let them have a little sniff from a distance (and still on the leash) first. Once they’ve had their first calm sniff, reward them with a stroke, treat and positive language. Keep repeating this exercise to let them know their calm behaviour is good behaviour.</p>
      <p>If they’re overexcitable and won’t calm down, then get someone to take them into another room and distract them until they’re calmer. Then try again with the above. This is likely a normal process when introducing a hyper dog to a baby… so prepare yourself for some repetition! Try to be patient with your dog and not get angry - as this will become a negative association with the baby.</p>
      <p>If you don’t feel like you’re making progress and it’s feeling difficult, then get someone your dog’s familiar with to look after them for a couple of days - and get some professional advice ASAP.</p>
      <strong>5. Don’t push your pooch out</strong>
      <p>Life with a new baby can be hectic! But consider it from your pooches point of view. It’s all new for them too, and your special pawrent/pooch bond might feel compromised to them.</p>
      <p>Share the love between both your baby and your dog, and try to still do things with your pooch that you did before. This will help them feel more comfortable with the new addition, which will form a positive family relationship between everyone.</p>
      <strong>6. Be patient</strong>
      <p>Feelings of resentment towards your dog during the early days can be completely normal. Yes, you absolutely adore them as you always have - but they may be testing your patience (especially if you’re sleep deprived too).</p>
      <p>Don’t let these feelings get the better of you - as everything your pooch will be doing will be through love for you. A newborn is a big change for them as well as you. Take it day-by-day and keep practicing the methods we’ve shared above. You’ll soon get to a place where your heart’s bursting with love for them again.</p>
      <strong>7. Feed some calming products</strong>
      <p>To help your pooch stay more chilled during introductions and beyond, it could be a good idea to feed them some calming products beforehand. We have our Calming Range of food, treats and supplements that taste amazing, and have calming ingredients that might help them feel more zen.</p>
      <h2 id="Different pooch behaviours and what they mean">Different pooch behaviours and what they mean</h2>
      <p>During the first few days and even after that, you might notice your dog acting differently. Here are some signs you may notice, what they might mean, and what you can do…</p>
      <h3 id="My dog is growling at my baby">My dog is growling at my baby</h3>
      <p>This is likely to be fear, jealousy or possessiveness. Although growling might panic you, it’s important to stay calm and not get angry - shouting at your dog will only cause them more stress, which could cause them to bite. Instead, follow the steps above, which are;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Always keep them under supervision</li>
        <li>Use learnt commands</li>
        <li>Move them into a space that feels safe for them, away from the baby</li>
        <li>Reward good behaviour</li>
        <li>Build-up further introductions at a slow pace</li>
        <li>If it continues and you’re concerned, then contact a behaviourist straight-away</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="My dog seems stressed when my baby cries">My dog seems stressed when my baby cries</h3>
      <p>This is completely normal behaviour. Dog’s pick up on the energy, and the sound of a baby crying could be upsetting for them. As mentioned earlier, before the baby arrives - try desensitising them to this noise by playing baby crying sounds.</p>
      <p>If this hasn’t worked and they seem distressed, then ensure they have their own safe haven to retreat to as an escapism. This could be their own room or cosy crate area if they’re crate-trained.</p>
      <h3 id="Why does my dog lick my baby?">Why does my dog lick my baby?</h3>
      <p>Your dog could be licking your baby for different reasons. It could be animal instinct, like they’d lick their puppies. They want to show affection and love towards this new little being, and this is their way. However, it could also be a sign of dominance - they could see the baby as their own, meaning anyone who tries to get near it could be in the firing-line.</p>
      <p>Although it’s probably sweet to watch, it needs to be nipped in the bud immediately for everyone’s safety. Not only this, babies have weaker immune systems so dog saliva could pass on infection. Reward them for sitting/lying nicely near the baby with their favourite treat.</p>
      <h3 id="What are the signs that my dog will attack my baby?">What are the signs that my dog will attack my baby?</h3>
      <p>Dog’s usually attack because of fear. Babies and children can be unpredictable with sudden moves and loud sounds which could make your pooch afraid. Keep a watch-out for subtle signs such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Yawning</li>
        <li>Lip licking</li>
        <li>Trembling</li>
        <li>Crouching</li>
        <li>Ears down</li>
        <li>Tail tucking</li>
        <li>Whale eye (showing whites of their eyes)</li>
        <li>Tensing and not moving</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you notice any of these signs, then immediately take your dog into their safe space away from your baby.</p>
      <p>It’s really important to remember that dogs and children should be supervised at all times. Even if your dog is usually calm and likes children, or is a certain breed that has a more relaxed nature - this isn’t enough. Supervision is always needed, for both your child’s and dog’s safety.</p>
      <h2 id="Teach your baby boundaries with your dog">Teach your baby boundaries with your dog</h2>
      <p>This isn’t really relevant for newborns, but as your baby starts to grow - introducing boundaries from their side is key too. Children love to investigate and can be rough with animals without realising what they’re doing.</p>
      <p>Setting boundaries with your tot from an early age is imperative, so they learn to respect the pooch and so any unexpected moves from them don’t trigger your dog. It’s a two-way street, and teaching the right lessons on both sides should build a happy relationship.</p>
      <p>Our Pooch and Mutt Dog Behaviourist, Dr Emma Scales-Theobald adds:</p>
      <p>"Bringing a new baby into the family is an exciting time, but can be unsettling for our dogs</p>
      <p>There are things we can do to help prepare them for this big change and help them feel comfortable once the baby arrives. It is important to keep an eye on our dogs and watch for behaviours that indicate how they are feeling.</p>
      <p>Allow your dog to adapt to these changes slowly, at their pace, and always make safety and supervision a priority. With space, patience and positive reinforcement, your fur baby will develop a lasting heartwarming bond with your baby."</p>

<p>The wet weather can be a mood-kill for both you and the pooch, but that doesn't mean the fun can't continue in other ways!</p>
      <p>We’ve pulled together a few ideas for some bonding time during those miserable rainy days:</p>
      <h2 id="1. Learn new tricks">1. Learn new tricks</h2>
      <p>Learning new tricks, games and commands can take time, but with the rain keeping you indoors, you have all the time in the world! It’s the perfect way to keep bored minds busy, and you can perform to friends and family to show them what a clever little pooch you have. Take a look at our 12 Enrichment Games blog piece for inspiration.</p>
      <h2 id="2. A day of poochy pampering">2. A day of poochy pampering</h2>
      <p>Yes, pooches love a pamper too! Pull together a pamper pack of dog shampoo and conditioner, paw & nose balm, toothbrush and meaty toothpaste, their favourite grooming brush and a scented, dog-friendly spritz to finish off. Incorporate a lovely relaxing dog massage (you can explore how-to videos on YouTube so you know you’re doing it correctly), and add in a few treats from our Calm & Relaxed range to help them feel extra zen. They will look, feel and smell amazing!</p>
      <h2 id="3. Retail therapy">3. Retail therapy</h2>
      <p>Why not treat them to a new toy and take them to their local pet store for a rummage round? They can sniff out a new favourite toy, and play around with the different squeaks, squarks and sensory stimulants of their surroundings. There are also plenty of high-street stores that are dog-friendly, as well as cafes that serve up a mean puppucino as well as a latte, so you can both get a little treat!</p>
      <p>Better yet, why not turn to our very own line of Pooch & Mutt toys and accessories? Whether your pooch needs a cuddly snuggle companion in the form of our trusty mascot Patch, or some tantalising mental stimulation with our Snuffle Ball or Treat Ball - all our toys are eco-friendly and will make for the most pawfect rainy day gift.</p>
      <h2 id="4. Take turns with an indoor pooch play-date">4. Take turns with an indoor pooch play-date</h2>
      <p>If they’re not getting their usual outdoor playtime with friends because of the rain, you could ask their furry friends around for the day! Your pooch can lead the way, and show their doggo BFFs all their toys and the best places to run riot around the house. Take turns with the other pawrents, so the pooches can enjoy a new environment and you can have some much-needed relaxation after a few hours of madness!</p>
      <h2 id="5. Embrace the wet weather!">5. Embrace the wet weather!</h2>
      <p>The usual way of rainy outdoor time is getting rain-coated up, and stomping through walkies as quickly as possible. But why not have a moment of madness, and allow yourself to get soaked through!? Play all the usual outdoor games, take a longer walk, and laugh at yourself and your pooch embracing the great British weather (please share pics, we would LOVE to see!).

You’ll feel liberated, energised and can look forward to a steaming hot shower and good book on your return.</p>

<p>How often do you find yourself scrolling through Instagram, stopping to coo and “awww” over pooch pics? You then feel all inspired, and try to recreate with your own bundle of floof at home… but it’s not quite as you imagined. Well, allow your good pals at Pooch & Mutt to give you a few easy-breezy tips, to capture that perfect money shot…</p>
      <h2 id="How do I get my dog to look at the camera?">How do I get my dog to look at the camera?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>First thing’s first, your pooch isn’t going to perform without an incentive. So make sure there’s some drool-worthy treats to hand, to entice them with. We have plenty of meaty treats to choose from that’ll do the trick</li>
        <li>You want them to look in the direction of wherever the treat’s dangling - so practice getting them to follow treats around in your hand, and getting into different positions</li>
        <li>Next up, you’ll need to practice the “sit” and “stay” commands. This sets them up nicely for positioning that perfect shot</li>
        <li>Now’s the time to combine tips 2 and 3 together. Use your commands, but move around with treats at the same time to get trying different angles</li>
        <li>Once they’ve got the hang of it, hold a treat at your nose, say “look at me!”, and they should be looking exactly where they need to - into the camera lens!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bonus tip: If the pooch is looking a little too serious, and it’s playful vibes you’re after - then try some fun games before tip 5. That way, they’ll have a gorgeous little tongue hanging out which gives that cheeky, jovial effect.</p>
      <h2 id="How do I take a good-quality picture of my dog?">How do I take a good-quality picture of my dog?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Natural light - natural light always makes portrait shots shine. It brings out all the beautiful details of their makeup, from how shiny their coat is, to the glistening in their eyes</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Get outdoors - pooches come to life amidst the great outdoors. So get them in their happy place, and the colours of nature against their excited demeanour will create a truly magical shot. If you can’t get outdoors, then choosing an interesting backdrop that complements their colours also works really well</li>
        <li>Get on your dog’s level  - allow the world to see life from your pooch’s perspective. Getting down onto their level with the camera will create an honest account of their everyday, and will become a super cute, interesting shot</li>
        <li>Auto-focus - there’s nothing quite as adorable as puppy dog eyes. So make sure your auto focus is there, and their crystal clear eyes will become the focal point of the picture</li>
        <li>Portrait mode - portrait mode on your phone will make your doggo the centre of attention, and everything else around a little more hazy. This allows for a really striking image</li>
        <li>Live shot - most smartphones have this setting, and it’s a great way to capture lots of pictures in a short burst. With live shot mode on, you can pick your favourite image that you otherwise might have missed with a standard setting</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Accessories - if your dog’s comfortable wearing accessories - this always makes for a loveable shot! Dress them up in different things, from their favourite harness, to a slogan bandana, to a little pooch hat - to whatever else you think looks great on them!</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="What can I do with my dog’s pictures?">What can I do with my dog’s pictures?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Give them their own Instagram account - if you’re anything like us, your social media will be filled with hundreds of your pooch’s pics. Why not step it up a notch, and create them their own account? This means you can post adorable photos until your heart’s content, share their everyday adventures with like-minded followers, and you might even make some new friends to go on doggo playdates with</li>
        <li>Frame them - what’s a family gallery wall without a pet portrait? Choose your favourite shots and weave them into your gallery wall, so visitors can see the whole family together - both hoomans and pets!</li>
        <li>Pop them on a card - whether it’s for pawrents, grandpawrents or anyone else who knows and loves your pet - a personalised card with their face on is the best gift EVER. Save them up for special occasions, and watch your loved-ones' faces light up</li>
      </ul>

<p>We can thank our pooches for a lot of things.</p>

<p>Pooch & Mutt, consistently one of the UK’s fastest growing pet food companies has been acquired by Vafo Group in a multi-million-pound deal.</p>
      <p>Vafo is Pooch & Mutt’s long-term production partner. They took a minority share in Pooch & Mutt in 2020, upped this to 40% in 2022 and have now acquired the final 60%.</p>
      <p>With Vafo’s financial and production backing Pooch & Mutt has grown over 400% in the last few years and is on track to turnover £18m in 2023.</p>
      <p>Pooch & Mutt’s founder, Guy Blaskey, will stay on at Pooch & Mutt as a CVO (Chief Visionary Officer) as well as continuing his role on the Vafo Group’s management team. Day to day running of Pooch & Mutt will be handled by MD Paul Dennison, who has been doing a fantastic job in that role for the last 12 months, along with Pooch & Mutt’s brilliant management team.</p>
      <p>Guy Blaskey commented, “We have been part of the Vafo Family for a few years now, and it genuinely does feel like a family. We are all aligned on making great quality products, to help pets lead their best lives.</p>
      <p>Unlike many corporate takeovers, this is not an exercise in efficiencies and cost cutting. Vafo has supported our growth over the last few years, during which time we have trebled out staff, quadruped our turnover and developed a whole host of amazing new products.</p>
      <p>The success is not just about the Pooch & Mutt brand. As part of the Vafo family we are the UK representatives for all of their manufacturing capabilities, which are the best and broadest in the European pet food market. We are working with them to supply some of the largest retailers in the country. Later in the year we have a 2nd brand launching, “Planet Pet Society” which has been a ‘pet project’ of mine to develop the world’s most sustainable pet food, based on ‘Second Chance Ingredients. Additionally, we are using our significant online capabilities to grow the group’s digital business across Europe. This is a really exciting for me, for the team and Pooch & Mutt and for the whole group.</p>
      <p>It’s great to see my baby grow up and go to a new home, and even better that I can stay involved and help it achieve the potential I have always known that is has.”</p>
      <p>Petr Kriz, Vafo board member responsible for M&A and strategy commented, “Pooch & Mutt’s growth since our first investment has been incredible. A lot of companies promise big things in investment pitches, but few deliver. Pooch & Mutt promised very big things and delivered far beyond them. The team have done an outstanding job and they will be a huge asset to the group”.</p>
      <p>Vafo is a 400m+ eur company, with 8 factories in The Czech Republic, Finland, Estonia and beyond. They are the owner of multiple category-leading brands as well as being private label manufacturers for most of the largest pet retailers in Europe.</p>

  content: `
<div>When summer’s in full swing and it’s feeling hot hot hot, the urge to take a dip and cool down is strong. The same goes for our pooches! Especially when they’re carrying ‘round a big fur coat. Outdoor swimming can be a great activity for them in many ways, but safety first - there’s plenty of precautions you should understand, to make sure they’re having a safe experience in the water.</div>
      <h2 id="Before the dog swim">Before the dog swim</h2>
      <p>Being prepared is key! It’ll put your mind as a pawrent at ease and will allow you to feel in full control of their swim. Let’s take a look at ways you can plan ahead:</p>
      <h3 id="Can they swim?">Can they swim?</h3>
      <p>We assume it’s a given that all dogs can swim, but that’s not the case. If your pooch is flat-faced, long-bodied, short-legged (or simply it’s just not their thing) they might struggle. A good way to test the water (literally), is by taking them in on lead to see how they react. If they’re in distress or seem afraid, then it’s a no-go and better to find alternative ways to keep them cool.</p>
      <h3 id="How’s their recall?">How’s their recall?</h3>
      <p>If your precious pooch has a tendency to deafen themselves to your instructions, outdoor swimming could be dangerous. It’s really important that when you call-out a command or whistle, they know it’s time to come back. Without good recall, it puts both you and your dog in a vulnerable situation if they hit difficulty. Plenty of training with food and toys could improve this, away from the water to begin with!</p>
      <h3 id="Make sure they’re microchipped">Make sure they’re microchipped</h3>
      <p>In the UK, it’s against the law to not have your pooch microchipped. It’s the most effective way to track them down if they go missing and get them back into your loving arms ASAP. This is especially true when out swimming.Outdoor waters have currents, which may take them to an area away from where they started - so make sure everything’s in order with their microchip before heading out.</p>
      <h3 id="Fresh water at the ready">Fresh water at the ready</h3>
      <p>Outdoor water is not what you want your pooch to be drinking. It’s full of nasties, and can actually be really dangerous to them. It can cause problems such as giardia, parasites, leptospirosis, and toxicity from blue green algae - amongst many more! Make sure you’ve stocked up on fresh water, give them a big bowl before they hit the water, and have it ready and waiting for their return.</p>
      <h3 id="Up-to-date parasite treatment">Up-to-date parasite treatment</h3>
      <p>This one’s a given for any outdoor activities, but especially outdoor swimming. Parasites like fleas, ticks and worms have a field-day around the water, and there’s only one place they want to live… on your pooch. Make sure their regular treatments are up-to-date and prevent bringing any unwanted pests home.</p>
      <h2 id="During the dog swim">During the dog swim</h2>
      <p>The prep’s done, now it’s time for them to get their paws wet. Be alert and vigilant, even if it looks as though they’re having a merry old time in there. Here’s some words of advice:</p>
      <h3 id="Pop on a life jacket">Pop on a life jacket</h3>
      <p>Even the strongest swimmers can get tired, and popping a doggo life jacket on them for the swim, keeps them afloat. You can both relax a little knowing it’s keeping them at surface level and the bright colour makes it even easier to keep your eagle-eyes on them.</p>
      <h3 id="Eyes on the prize">Eyes on the prize</h3>
      <p>Never take your eyes off them! Underwater conditions, drop offs, and currents can all be hazards when outdoor swimming. Keep a watchful look-out for changing conditions and know your dog’s ability too.</p>
      <h3 id="A tired pooch">A tired pooch</h3>
      <p>A tired pooch is at risk of drowning. If you can see them wearing out or they’ve been swimming for a while, get them to come back to land, in a shady spot, with plenty of fresh water. Lots of breaks are essential - so they can enjoy the swim with lots of energy!</p>
      <h3 id="Blue green algae">Blue green algae</h3>
      <p>Blue green algae is a bacteria called cyanobacteria and can often be found in outdoor waters. Always keep yourself and your pet away from this as the toxins are extremely dangerous. They can cause skin irritation, respiratory effects, gastroenteritis symptoms, liver damage, nervous system toxicity, and even death. Find a clear stretch of water, just to be sure.</p>
      <h2 id="After the dog swim">After the dog swim</h2>
      <p>Swimming after-care is just as important as the other stages. Follow our tips below and they’ll be all set for their next adventure…</p>
      <h3 id="Give them a good rinse-off">Give them a good rinse-off</h3>
      <p>When the fun’s over, a good rinse off with fresh, clean water will keep them in tip-top condition. Do as much as you can as soon as they’re out of the water, then treat them to a bath once you’re home. Make sure they’re properly dried off too, especially around the inside of the ears.</p>
      <h3 id="Watch-out for sickness or allergies">Watch-out for sickness or allergies</h3>
      <p>Hopefully, if the above steps have been actioned, they should be fine. But sometimes these things come out of the blue! If you notice any skin irritations, itching or any other symptoms which are out of character - then speak to your vet immediately. Let them know your dog’s been outdoor swimming and give them as much info as possible.</p>
      <h2 id="Pooch CPR - be in the know!">Pooch CPR - be in the know!</h2>
      <p>As a pet owner, knowing how to perform CPR on a dog could save their life. This is useful in all situations, and especially when swimming.</p>
      <p>Have fun and be safe!!</p>

<p>No matter how much we pour affection onto our dogs, many of them are anxious creatures - easily spooked by a bird at the window, a passing pooch or even a friendly neighbour at the door. It’s not unusual if your dog gets freaked out occasionally; in fact, a Finnish study of almost 14,000 dogs showed that an incredible 72 percent of them could be considered anxious (1). That’s a lot of nervous pups!</p>
      <p>So how can we ease our dogs’ anxiety? In this article, we go in-depth about anxiety in dogs and unpack some of the most common reasons your dog might be anxious. If you’d like to get to the bottom of your dog’s on-edge behaviour, read on to get some expert tips and advice for soothing their nerves and calming them down.</p>
      <h2 id="Why is my dog anxious?">Why is my dog anxious?</h2>
      <p>The reasons for a dog’s anxiety are wide-reaching - some dogs are affected by traumatic experiences in their past, while for others, the cause could be as simple as having a different dog food bowl than they’re used to.</p>
      <p>There are scenarios that will commonly unsettle a dog, however, and they usually include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Change of environment - If you’ve recently moved house or renovated your home in some way, your dog may take a while to adjust to their new surroundings.</li>
        <li>Other dogs or pets in the home - If your pooch has spent a while being the only dog you dote on, having unfamiliar dogs or new pets in the house may appear threatening until they get to know them better.</li>
        <li>Strangers or new people - If you have a new partner, a new baby or have unfamiliar people in the house, even a delivery person regularly knocking the door, this can be frightening to dogs who are naturally territorial.</li>
        <li>Dietary changes - Have you changed your dog’s diet recently? Perhaps they’ve eaten lots of treats or human leftovers? There’s a strong relationship between food and behaviour (read on for more), and some foods can exacerbate a dog’s reaction to common stressors.</li>
        <li>Noises caused by storms, building works or fireworks - Lots of dogs hate loud noises, but if it’s a continual racket caused by the likes of neighbours, bad weather or construction, your dog might suffer from sensory overload.</li>
        <li>Crowds - Similarly, having a party in the house, or taking your dog to a place with lots of people and stimulation can be too much activity for them to handle.</li>
        <li>Being left alone - Dogs form strong attachments to their owners, and if left alone without their dog parents for too long, they can develop separation anxiety.</li>
        <li>Past experiences - The most anxious of dogs have usually become so due to their past experiences. When dogs have been traumatised in their past, they don’t feel as consistently safe as dogs who have had a secure, loving upbringing.</li>
        <li>Some breeds are prone to anxiety - All dogs can be anxious, but some breeds are more prone to becoming on edge, and particularly experiencing separation anxiety when left alone. These include Border Collies, Bichon Frises, German Shepherds and Cocker Spaniels.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="Symptoms of anxiety in dogs">Symptoms of anxiety in dogs</h2>
      <p>If you’re not sure how to detect whether your dog is feeling anxiety, that’s fair enough - sometimes it can be difficult to differentiate whether your pooch is scared or excited. On the other extreme, some dogs become quiet and withdrawn when they’re anxious, which could easily go unnoticed if you’re busy. Generally speaking, common symptoms of anxiety in dogs include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Barking and whining more</li>
        <li>Tense body language, including quivering or cowering</li>
        <li>Becoming aggressive, hostile or destructive</li>
        <li>Hiding away, or becoming quiet and withdrawn</li>
        <li>Digestive issues, such as excessive gas or going to the toilet in the house</li>
        <li>Low appetite, or stopping eating entirely.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="How to calm an anxious dog">How to calm an anxious dog</h2>
      <p>It’s not fun to see your dog in a state of stress, no matter what the cause. So, what are the best ways to calm your anxious pooch, and be aware of their anxieties so you can reduce the chance of it happening again? Here are some tips and strategies to help your dog cope with their tense emotions.</p>
      <h3 id="Tips to calm a stressed dog">Tips to calm a stressed dog</h3>
      <p>If your dog is displaying anxiety symptoms, try to identify the cause and if possible, put some distance between your pooch and the stressor.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Take them for a walk or to enjoy some form of exercise like playing with a ball outside. The immediate change in surroundings and activity should calm them.</li>
        <li>Soothe them with snuggles. While it’s important not to overly fuss, let your dog know you’re there to keep them safe by touching and stroking them. Mild massage of the face or back muscles may also help them to physically let go of tension.</li>
        <li>Provide a safe space. Your dog should have a place to escape to when they’re overstimulated, such as a covered den or bed, or a room that’s quiet and cool so they can be alone. Ensure this place is always clean, airy and smells good, without harsh lighting or distractions.</li>
        <li>Apply mild pressure to your dog. Some dogs respond to pressure when stressed, such as from a weighted blanket or a dog anxiety wrap.</li>
        <li>Play music. Particularly useful for separation anxiety, pleasant music such as classical, piano or harp music can be soothing for a dog and block out harsh noises.</li>
        <li>Try simple commands. If your pooch won’t settle down, distracting them with simple training tasks can divert their attention. Reward them a treat afterwards.</li>
        <li>Consider their diet Unbeknownst to their owners, some dogs are nervous because their diet has them feeling fidgety and uncomfortable. The gut and brain are intrinsically linked, so if your dog isn’t digesting their food properly or has an underlying allergy, such as grain or wheat, it could be causing them discomfort and distress.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="How to calm an anxious dog at night">How to calm an anxious dog at night</h3>
      <p>Is it at night time that your dog just won’t settle? If you have a pooch who gets spooked when it’s time to sleep, here are some tips to help them wind down each evening.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stick to a bedtime routine. When a dog has a regular meal time, bedtime and place they usually sleep, they’ll want to sleep at the same time each night. If your pooch doesn’t have a bedtime routine, start one as soon as possible, because getting them to sleep will be much harder.</li>
        <li>Keep a calm, safe sleeping area for your dog to rest in. A comfortable bed, cosy blankets and a cool, dark environment each night should have them snoozing in no time.</li>
        <li>Consider their feeding routine. Does your pooch eat dinner very close to bedtime? This means they’ll still be digesting food when it’s time to sleep, which could disrupt their sleeping patterns.</li>
        <li>Use an oil diffuser. Lots of dog owners have success using an oil diffuser, as the sweet smells gently send their dog to sleep. Be sure to use diluted oil in a calming scent dogs appreciate, such as lavender.</li>
        <li>Introduce a bedtime toy or blanket. If your dog has a toy you give them to snuggle specifically at bed time, that toy will become a clever sleep trigger, letting them know that it’s time for bed. Over time, they may end up getting it out to let you know they’re sleepy.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="Tips for separation anxiety in dogs">Tips for separation anxiety in dogs</h3>
      <p>The bond between dogs and owners is so strong that many form separation anxiety. If you’ve noticed your dog getting severely anxious each time you leave the house, or you return to a trail of mess and destruction each time your pooch has been left alone, there are some straightforward steps you can take to ease their distress.</p>
      <p>Give your dog reasons to be entertained while you’re not around. This could be as simple as leaving a few treats hidden around the house, placing a few toys or interactive dog puzzles around to distract them. Music is also particularly comforting to dogs, or you could even experiment with Dog TV. To be certain they remain comfortable, take them out for a walk so they can go to the toilet before you leave, and close curtains if you live on a road with passers-by.</p>
      <p>If your pooch is racked with grief every time you go out without them, try not to leave them for too long. If you’re planning to go out for a while, get a trusted dog sitter to play with them and keep your devoted pooch company.</p>
      <h3 id="How to calm dog anxiety naturally">How to calm dog anxiety naturally</h3>
      <p>Heard of the gut-brain axis? Yep - it’s scientifically proven that even for dogs, stress and anxiety is intrinsically linked to activity in the gut (2). Therefore, there are plenty of ways to reduce anxiety through nutritional means to reduce anxiety - such as adding natural gut-boosting ingredients to your dog’s food, or trying natural anti-anxiety supplements for dogs.</p>
      <p>Try giving your pooch a boost of gut-supporting probiotics, either with probiotic supplements for dogs or with a calming dry food; it can help address the balance of friendly bacteria in their tum, instilling a sense of ease and wellbeing throughout their body and mind.</p>
      <p>Or for a bite-size dose of calm that tastes great too, calming treats for dogs contain naturally soothing ingredients such as hemp, chamomile and even turkey, which helps produce serotonin (the happy hormone) with its key amino-acid, L-tryptophan.</p>
      <p>Winding down…</p>
      <p>Now that you’re clued up on the most common reasons for anxiety-ridden pooches, remember that every dog is unique - so keep a close eye on yours to work out exactly what spooks them.</p>
      <p>When it comes to easing a dog’s anxiety, taking a holistic approach is best, considering their environment, routines and diet. If you’ve tried all of the above, however, and your dog still works themselves up on a regular basis, take them to the vet for a check up; it could be that they have an underlying condition and would benefit from anxiety medication.</p>
      <p>Pooch & Mutt have a range of tasty, grain-free dog treats and anti-anxiety supplements to calm a dog’s nerves. You could also try our Calm & Relaxed recipe, specially formulated for anxious dogs. For more information about dogs with anxiety, get in touch with us to chat further.</p>

<div>It may seem like dogs are happy to just play fetch, go for regular walks and chow down on tasty food twice a day, but dogs are smart cookies. Feeding your dog a healthy, balanced diet goes a long way in keeping them mentally nourished, but another way to boost your pooch’s mood as well as mental stimulation is with enrichment activities. Dogs love playtime, puzzles, games and toys - because just like us, when they problem-solve for a reward, it boosts their confidence and brain power.</div>
      <p>There are so many ways to offer your clever pooch an enrichment game every day - read on as we dig further into doggy enrichment and tell you about our favourite enrichment games for dogs.</p>
      <h2 id="What is dog enrichment?">What is dog enrichment?</h2>
      <p>The verb ‘to enrich’ means to enhance or improve the quality of something; so when we talk about dog enrichment activities, we’re coming up with ways to enhance a dog’s life and wellbeing. Usually it refers to activities that trigger a dog’s natural instincts such as digging or foraging, stimulating brain activities like puzzles or training, or something fun like playing with games and toys.</p>
      <p>Dog enrichment is vital to a dog’s quality of life and should be a big priority for you as a dog owner. You may not even realise your dog’s talents and skills without giving them the chance to challenge themselves! Enrichment can also boost a dog’s confidence, calm their nerves and improve the trusting bond between dog and owner.

Enrichment provides the same benefits for puppies and also helps them burn off some of their pent-up energy.

With so much learning, exploring and growing to do, puppies often have tons of energy (as most exhausted puppy owners will concur!) to burn. And whilst they're too young to go outside, finding other ways to keep them enriched and avoid boredom is crucial.

For ways to effectively tire out your puppy alongside enrichment play, be sure to check out our guide; 'How to tire out your high-energy puppy'.</p>
      <h2 id="12 dog enrichment ideas">12 dog enrichment ideas</h2>
      <p>So what activities can we do with our smart pooch to push their boredom aside and improve their lives each day? Here are a few of our favourite dog enrichment ideas to try out with you and your pooch…</p>
      <p>1. Go fetch (classic)

What kind of enrichment list would this be without the all-time classic pastime for dogs? Throwing a ball or toy and having your dog bring it back to you is an easy way to appeal to your dog’s chase and return instincts, as well as great exercise. Play it on a large scale in a field, park or on the beach, or try a mini game in the garden or even indoors. 
 
Sure, not all dogs can ‘fetch’ - some go after the ball then run away with it, others get distracted by dogs or birds while running to the ball, while others switch into tug-of-war mode when it comes to the return stage (see below). 
 
If your pooch is one of those dogs who struggles with fetch, try using healthy dog treats to reward them once they complete one ‘fetch’.</p>
      <p>2. Tug-of-war
Most pooches love a game of tug, there’s something so fun about trying to take an item from you when you won’t let them. Be gentle when playing tug, as getting too boisterous or vicious with it can cause more harm than good. To play it correctly, be sure your pooch is pulling on the toy or rope more than you are, keep the toy low to the ground, and don’t drag your dog around by the toy unless they are leading. 
 
You could even make your own ‘rope’ by tying old t-shirts or rags together with big, chewable knots.</p>
      <p>3. Upstairs, downstairs
Some dogs like to drop and chase a toy up and down stairs. To test this, throw a toy or ball up the stairs and ask your dog to fetch it, then when they’re at the top of the stairs, ask them to ‘stay’ and ‘drop’ the toy. When the ball or toy falls down the stairs, it’s likely your dog will follow the cue to chase after it, then run back up the stairs to do it again.</p>
      <p>4. ‘Magic’ tricks 
Playing magic tricks with your dog can be very entertaining. A funny game (popular on TikTok) is to get your dog’s attention, hold up a towel in front of yourself, then run behind a door as you drop the towel, giving the impression you’ve disappeared. Your dog will be baffled and try to look for you. 
 
Another great game is to sit your dog at a small table, hide healthy dog treats under one of three upside-down cups, and move the cups around to test your dog’s reactions. You could even try asking them which cup the treat is under and lift the cups until they find the treat (note: only patient dogs will respond to this!).</p>
      <p>5. Digging for gold
We all know dogs love to dig - where they are allowed to dig is a trickier conundrum. If you’re lucky enough to live near a beach, taking a dog to dig in the sand is a huge source of enjoyment for them, and causes less of a mess than letting them go mad in the garden. If your pooch hides treats by burying them in the garden, there’s a few reasons why that might be.</p>
      <p>6. Toy changeover
If your dog has a collection of toys, it’s like some get more attention than others. Why not hide a few away for a couple of weeks, then swap them, so toys are always on rotation? Your pooch will feel like they’ve been treated to new toys and get some fresh mental stimulation from their differences. Tip: perhaps don’t try this with their favourite toy!</p>
      <p>7. Train to win  
Training your pooch new tricks is the perfect way to entertain them, build their confidence and create new neural pathways in their smart doggy brains. If they don’t know already, teaching them to give you a paw, sit, roll over, reach up on their hind legs or jump through hoops are great beginner tricks to learn. Be sure to reward them with a tasty doggy treat whenever they get it right.</p>
      <p>8. Hunting for treats
Dogs have strong search instincts, especially breeds such as Basset Hounds, Beagles and Border Collies. Set up a scavenger hunt in the house or garden, with treats hidden in easy to reach places so they’ll follow their nose to seek the rewards. It helps if the dog treats are strongly scented - perhaps use natural beef jerky for dogs or make your dog treats juicier with a bit of warm water.</p>
      <p>9. Interactive feeders
Another way for your dog to work for their treat is to use interactive feeders or puzzle toys. These gadgets usually require your pooch to spend some time using hatches, levers, balancing, nooks and crannies in order to release the treat hidden inside. It’s a smart way of encouraging slow feeding and it keeps them occupied - particularly if you’re going out for a few hours.</p>
      <p>10. DIY doggy puzzles
As well as shop-bought enrichment toys, you can easily make your own using items around the house. Try the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Toilet roll feeder Try standing a bunch of empty toilet roll holders upright in a tray, with treats hidden inside a couple of the holders. Your pooch will have to use his senses to find the right rolls with tasty, natural dog treats inside!</li>
        <li>Feeding pad You can fashion a slow feeding pad out of a silicone ice-cube tray covered in peanut butter or wet food. You could also try hiding a treat in one or two of the holes.</li>
        <li>Towel burrito Try rolling up some treats in a towel with lots of folds, like a burrito, then lay it in front of your dog to unwrap and find the goods.</li>
        <li>Obstacle course Use household items such as a children’s tunnel, buckets, a bouncy ball and cones to create an obstacle course in the garden, using treats to teach them how to complete it.</li>
        <li>Doggy den - Dogs love to hide and snuggle inside their own space. Use a cardboard box or broom handles and bedsheets to forge a den or fort for your Pooch, then hide some treats inside.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>11. Games in the garden
If you or your children are playing in the garden, your pooch will love to get involved and play, too! Singing and dancing games, popping bubbles, playing chase or kicking a football may seem like human games, but dogs can’t tell the difference and will only see a chance to play.</p>
      <p>12. Play dates with doggy friends
Dogs are pack animals by nature, and even shy girls and boys should get a lot out of socialising with other dogs. If you have a friend with a dog, why not invite them around for a play date? If your dog isn’t the most confident around other pooches, it’s still advisable that you take them for walks in places where they can see other dogs around them.</p>
      <p>Do you use other dog enrichment activities to boost your dog’s mood? We’d love to hear about them. Meanwhile, if you’re planning to set up some dog enrichment games for your pooch, try using Pooch & Mutt’s range of grain-free treats for dogs to give them a tasty reward.</p>

<p>Are you considering including your dog in your wedding festivities? While it can be a lovely way to honour your furry best friend, there are some important considerations to remember to ensure that everything goes smoothly.</p>
      <p>Dog Behaviourist at Dr Emma Scales-Theobald, PhD, shares the do's and don'ts of including your dog in your wedding, from making sure your dog is properly trained and socialised to creating a comfortable and safe space for them during the event.</p>
      <p>These tips will help ensure your dog is happy, healthy, and well-behaved throughout the celebration, whether it’s a small home garden wedding or an extravagant affair!</p>
      <p>By following these do's and don'ts, you can ensure your dog is a happy and well-behaved guest at your wedding. With a bit of planning and preparation, you can make your special day a family-friendly affair that includes your furry best friend:</p>
      <h2 id="Things you should do if you want to include your dog at your wedding">Things you should do if you want to include your dog at your wedding</h2>
      <h3 id="Make sure your dog is up-to-date on all necessary vaccinations">Make sure your dog is up-to-date on all necessary vaccinations</h3>
      <p>and is in good health before bringing them to the wedding. "It's important to remember that large gatherings of people and other animals can increase the risk of disease transmission," says Dr Emma. "Make sure your dog is protected by keeping their vaccinations up to date and ensuring they are in good overall health."</p>
      <h3 id="Consider your dogs temperament and personality">Consider your dogs temperament and personality</h3>
      <p>when deciding whether to include them in your wedding. "Not all dogs are well-suited to loud, crowded events like weddings," cautions Dr Emma. "If your dog is anxious or easily overwhelmed, it may be best to leave them at home. It's important for dog owners to understand their dog's body language and behaviour cues. Signs of stress, anxiety, or discomfort in dogs can include panting, pacing, whining, lip licking, and avoidance behaviours. If a dog is showing these signs, it's important to remove them from the situation or provide them with a safe space to retreat to. Calming collars that release pheromones can help to reduce stress and anxiety, as well as calming treats.</p>
      <h3 id="Have a plan in place for managing your dogs behaviour">Have a plan in place for managing your dogs behaviour</h3>
      <p>during the wedding. "Dogs can become overwhelmed by crowds and noise, so it's important to have a strategy for managing their behaviour. Consider enlisting the help of a professional dog trainer or handler to assist with managing your dog during the wedding. They can also provide guidance on how to manage your dog's behaviour before the big day.”</p>
      <h3 id="Make sure your dog is properly lead-trained and crate-trained">Make sure your dog is properly lead-trained and crate-trained</h3>
      <p>before the wedding. "A well-trained dog is less likely to cause disruptions or become a distraction during the wedding. Make sure your dog is comfortable on a lead and is crate-trained if you plan to crate them during the event."</p>
      <h3 id="Consider your dogs dietary needs and schedule">Consider your dogs dietary needs and schedule</h3>
      <p>when planning your wedding. "Make sure your dog has access to plenty of fresh water and that they are fed at their usual times," recommends Dr Emma. "Bringing along some of their favourite treats can also help keep them calm and happy."</p>
      <h3 id="Have a plan in place for toilet breaks.">Have a plan in place for toilet breaks.</h3>
      <p>“Make sure your dog has a designated toilet area throughout the event. You can consider designating a responsible family member or friend to take your dog outside for toilet breaks as needed.”</p>

      <p>"Some venues may require that dogs be kept on a leash at all times, for example, or may not allow dogs in certain areas of the property. Make sure you're aware of the rules and regulations so that you can plan accordingly."</p>
      <h3 id="Keep a close eye on your dog when children are around.">Keep a close eye on your dog when children are around.</h3>
      <p>“Even the most well-behaved dog can become overwhelmed or anxious in these situations, leading to them accidentally knocking over or jumping on a child. In addition to keeping a close eye on them, educating any children attending on how to interact with dogs safely is important. This includes teaching them not to approach a dog showing signs of stress or anxiety, to ask permission before petting them, and to avoid approaching them while eating or drinking.”</p>
      <h3 id="Make sure your dog is not allowed near any food or dr during the wedding.">Make sure your dog is not allowed near any food or dr during the wedding.</h3>
      <p>Keep your dog away from potential hazards, such as food tables or decorations that may be tempting for your pup to explore. This will prevent your dog from ingesting harmful substances or foods and causing potential health problems.</p>
      <h3 id="Provide plenty of exercise.">Provide plenty of exercise.</h3>
      <p>“Make sure your dog has plenty of exercise and playtime before the wedding to help reduce their energy levels and prevent them from becoming restless or bored during the ceremony.”</p>

      <p>“Despite your best efforts, there is always a chance that your dog may become overwhelmed or behave unexpectedly during the wedding. Have a backup plan in place, such as a quiet room or a designated pet sitter, in case you need to remove your dog from the event.”</p>

      <h3 id="Dont force your dog to participate or interact with guests">Dont force your dog to participate or interact with guests</h3>
      <p>if they seem unhappy or uncomfortable. "Remember that not all dogs enjoy being the centre of attention, and not all guests may be comfortable around dogs.  If your dog seems hesitant or uninterested in interacting with guests, don't force them to do so. Instead, provide them with a quiet and comfortable area to rest. Equally, if your dog seems unhappy or uncomfortable, it may be best to let them sit this one out.</p>
      <h3 id="Don’t forget to dress them for success.">Don’t forget to dress them for success.</h3>
      <p>“If you plan on dressing your dog up for the wedding, make sure the outfit is comfortable and properly fitted. Avoid any accessories that may be choking hazards or restrict their breathing or movement. Booking a grooming session ahead of the big day so your dog looks and feels their best will also prevent any muddy paw mishaps”</p>

      <p>to clean up after your dog during the wedding. "Accidents can happen, so it's important to be prepared. Bringing along extra waste bags and cleaning supplies can help ensure that your dog doesn't cause any disruptions or mess."</p>

      <p>for your dog to rest during the wedding. "Weddings can be overwhelming for dogs, especially those unfamiliar with large crowds or noisy environments.

      <p>"Make sure to inform your wedding planner, venue and guests about your dog's presence and any special accommodations they may need. This can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and that your dog is included in the wedding festivities safely and comfortably."</p>
      <h3 id="Dont forget to have a plan for transporting your dog to and from the wedding.">Dont forget to have a plan for transporting your dog to and from the wedding.</h3>

<p>The days are warming, daffodils are swaying and the toasty smell of hot cross buns wafts from the kitchen… and d’you know what that means? That’s right! It’s time to set up an Easter egg hunt for your dog! We spend the long Easter weekend indulging in roast dinners and chocolate eggs, so why should our beloved canine friends miss out on the fun?</p>
      <p>There are safety precautions to consider - the most obvious point being that dogs should never eat human chocolate - but using the right treats and careful preparation, we bet you that any pooch will love a seasonal ‘follow the scent’ game come Easter time. It’s easy to set up and good fun for the whole family.</p>
      <p>Here’s how to set up an Easter egg hunt for your lucky dog…</p>
      <h2 id="Can I really set up an Easter egg hunt for my dog?">Can I really set up an Easter egg hunt for my dog?</h2>
      <p>Definitely! Dogs are natural seekers; they have keen senses of smell and love to follow their noses to find a secret treasure. Funnily enough, they also love to eat tasty treats - so a doggy Easter egg hunt is almost a no-brainer! The most important aspect is to choose the right treats, keep it as safe as possible and supervise your pooch(es) at all times.</p>
      <h2 id="How to create a dog-friendly Easter egg hunt">How to create a dog-friendly Easter egg hunt</h2>
      <h3 id="1. Choose the right eggs">1. Choose the right eggs</h3>
      <p>First up, the eggs! Plastic eggs work best for hiding dog food and treats, but getting the right ones is important; they can’t be so small that your pooch will accidentally swallow them, nor should they be able to chew them to pieces. Medium-sized plastic eggs that separate in half are ideal - even better if they have holes, or you’re able to drill holes in them, so your dog is able to catch the smell of the treats inside.</p>
      <p>As an exciting alternative, you could include a few Easter Treats for dogs - at Pooch & Mutt we have some that are just perfect for scattering around the garden, or hiding away as the tastiest and final egg in the hunt!</p>
      <h2><strong>Just remember that human chocolate eggs are strictly prohibited during a doggy Easter egg hunt, as chocolate is toxic to dogs.&nbsp;</strong></h2>
      <h3 id="2. Choose the perfect setting">2. Choose the perfect setting</h3>
      <p>A good-sized, private garden is the ideal place for an Easter egg hunt - you can let your dog off the lead, and they’re already familiar with the environment. If you want to take it into a public space like a park, field or beach, make sure your dog is on a lead, you guide them to the hiding places and your treats won’t be nabbed by other curious dogs in the area.</p>
      <h3 id="3. Fill your eggs with tasty trackable treats">3. Fill your eggs with tasty trackable treats</h3>
      <p>Strongly scented treats are the most successful for an egg hunt, as your pooch should be able to follow their nose to find them! Place a small piece of treat or food in each egg and be sure the egg is secured (we’ll go into what treats to use later).</p>
      <h3 id="4. Scatter them around the location">4. Scatter them around the location</h3>
      <p>Hide the eggs all over the location - in bushes, under garden seats, partly buried in the earth, or perhaps in a garden box or crate. Be sure the eggs are accessible and your pooch needn’t hurt themselves by getting the egg (up a tree or floating in a pond, for example, would be too risky).</p>
      <h3 id="5. Accompany each dog on their hunt">5. Accompany each dog on their hunt</h3>
      <p>Whether it’s just your dog partaking in the Easter egg hunt, two or a few, accompany each dog while they’re sniffing out the eggs. This is for a couple of reasons:</p>
      <p>If there are multiple dogs, one enthused dog may run over all others and find every egg! If you’re able to hold this dog back, or have each dog in your party take turns, it will be fairer on the smaller, slower dogs. Secondly, you don’t want any dog to end up chowing down on a plastic egg while you’re not looking.</p>
      <h3 id="Have a human open each egg then remove">Have a human open each egg then remove</h3>
      <p>Once your smart pooch has located an egg, give them lots of praise! Then open it up yourself so the dog can safely eat the treat - and remove any empty plastic eggs so that they don’t become the victim of a chew-fest later on.</p>
      <h3 id="Top tips for your doggy Easter egg hunt">Top tips for your doggy Easter egg hunt</h3>
      <b>Let your dog watch you preparing/filling the eggs</b>
      <p>At first, your dog might be quite confused as you enthusiastically point them around the garden, so make it easier by showing them the eggs, and the process of you filling the eggs. This way, when they follow their nose and find an egg, they’ll remember there is something delicious in store.</p>
      <b>If there are multiple dogs, have them take turns</b>
      <p>If you’re going all out and having an Easter doggy party, there may be some pooches that can’t find eggs as quickly as others (small dogs, puppies or seniors, for example). To get around this, have dogs do their own individual hunt, or perhaps have two dogs at a time carry out the search - always accompanied by their owners.</p>
      <b>Use a small amount of treat for each egg</b>
      <p>With so many eggs to hunt down, your pooch can end up eating a whole lot if you’re not careful - so place only a small treat or piece of food in each egg. It will be better for their health and digestion and prevent them from suffering from bloating, gassiness or sickness later in the day.</p>
      <b>Don’t mix up the doggy Easter egg hunt with a children’s version</b>
      <p>We’ll say it once more for the seats at the back - human chocolate is toxic to dogs! With this in mind, avoid having any chocolate eggs or sweets in the same environment as the doggy Easter egg hunt. It’s best to have a coinciding children’s egg hunt in a different location or even on a different day. If that’s not possible, be sure to clean up thoroughly between each egg hunt.</p>
      <h3 id="Best Easter treats for dogs">Best Easter treats for dogs</h3>
      <p>Our Easter Treats for dogs are packed with lamb, chicken and vibrant spring greens to restore vital nutrients and support immunity.</p>
      <p>Doggy chocolate Human chocolate is a big no-no for dogs - and we don’t recommend chocolate-based dog treats all year round, but a small dog - friendly chocolate in an Easter egg hunt is just for fun!</p>
      <p>Jerky for dogs An intensely meaty treat, a small piece of beef jerky for dogs is high protein, satisfyingly chewy and sure to give off a delicious smell, too.</p>
      <p>Fresh meat Some leftover meat from your Easter meal could be a great addition to the egg hunt. Fresh chicken or lamb, for example, without any added oil or salt is sure to be lapped up immediately!</p>
      <p>So - ready to set up your own doggy Easter egg hunt?</p>
      <p>Try our seasonal Easter treats for dogs; a delicious treat perfect for hiding in the garden! Or mix it up with Pooch & Mutt’s range of delicious grain-free dog treats. Each flavour combination is super tasty yet packed with specially chosen, natural ingredients to keep your dog happy, energised and healthy.</p>

  },
  content: `
<p>TikTok users are now extending the dating term ‘the ick’, referring to being suddenly put off by someone you were once attracted to, to their dogs.</p>
      <p>In candid videos, dog owners can be seen reeling off their dogs’ traits that irk them the most, often joined by their oblivious four-legged friend!</p>
      <p>However, although many traits are innocent, cheeky mistakes, most have a simple explanation and can be easily fixed with training and time. Read on to find out how.</p>
      <h2 id="Being dramatic about nail trims">Being dramatic about nail trims</h2>
      <p>Explanation: It’s very normal for dogs to resist having their nails trimmed because it's unfamiliar with their daily routine. If your dog isn’t introduced to nail clippers at a young age or regularly visiting the groomer, touching their paws and nails will be an unfamiliar experience. Some dogs might also associate nail trimming with a negative experience, which can lead to anxiety and fear.</p>
      <p>How to fix it: If you want to cut your dog's nails at home, slowly introducing nail clippers can make the experience more relaxing. First, get your dog comfortable with having their paws and nails touched by you and rewarding this behaviour. You can then introduce the nail clippers and let your pup get used to seeing them or just putting the clippers next to, or on, their paws. Provide positive reinforcement with treats and praise as you do this.</p>
      <p>You can even try snipping dry pieces of pasta and following with a reward so your dog gets used to the sound of the nail being cut. It’s important to take a lot of care when trimming your dog's nails to avoid cutting the very sensitive living quick that runs through the core of their nails.</p>
      <p>If your dog is still hesitant after continuous training, seek the advice of a professional groomer or veterinarian who will be well-trained in trimming nails quickly and efficiently. You can also try training with a scratchboard (essentially a large nail file for dogs) or having more regular walks on concrete or pavement to increase the time between trims.</p>
      <h2 id="Licking your face">Licking your face</h2>
      <p>Explanation: Whilst a little lick on your cheek every once in a while is usually quite sweet and is often your dog's way of showing affection and bonding with you, over-enthusiastic licking of your face and mouth can be gross, knowing where your dog’s mouth and tongue have been!</p>
      <p>Other reasons your dog might like licking your face include getting your attention, trying to groom you or even as a sign of submission. The most common reason is your dog's highly developed sense of taste - our skin is salty and tastes great to our pooches!</p>
      <p>How to fix it: If you want your dog to respect your personal boundaries (and hygiene!), practice redirecting their attention to a toy or treat when they try to lick your face. You can also practice the “off” command. It’s important to be patient when teaching your dog any command but positive reinforcement and consistency will reduce the face licking in no time.</p>
      <h2 id="Having to bribe them to do anything!">Having to bribe them to do anything!</h2>
      <p>Explanation: Using food, treats and toys as rewards every time you give your dog a command can feel like you constantly have to bribe them, but truthfully, offering rewards is just a great method of training and reinforcing positive or good behaviour. It can also help build your dog's confidence and trust in you as an owner.</p>
      <p>How to fix it: Dogs are highly motivated by rewards, but these don’t have to be tangible. Some dogs are motivated by verbal and physical praise from their owners, like cuddles and scratches, whereas others will be over the moon just going on a walk with their human best friend. Working dogs may also find the opportunity to engage in activities like herding or retrieving as rewards too.</p>
      <p>So, while it may seem like you’re constantly bribing, remember that understanding what motivates your dog is one of the most effective ways to train them and build your relationship.</p>
      <h2 id="Having so many toys but still rather chewing cardboard">Having so many toys but still rather chewing cardboard</h2>
      <p>Explanation: There are a few reasons why your dog would rather chew cardboard than play with their toys. If your pup has regular access to their toys, an object like a cardboard box will be much more interesting to explore than toys they may be more familiar with. The texture may also appeal to their chewing instincts, especially with teething puppies.</p>
      <p>Chewing any cardboard they can get their paws on can also signify boredom and indicate that your dog needs more mental stimulation.</p>
      <p>How to fix it: If you find it’s happening often, try enrichment activities like playing with them, walking, or a quick training session. Some pups may also chew on objects as a way to cope with anxiety and stress.</p>
      <p>While chewing on plain cardboard is fine, you must ensure your dog is not ingesting large pieces, as this can cause blockages in their digestive system. To minimise any cardboard chewing habits, I’d recommend not giving your dog constant access to their toys, e.g. a toy basket, and instead bringing different toys out daily for a playing session before storing them away to keep them new and interesting objects for your dog to explore and play with you.</p>
      <p>You can also give them other safe and appropriate chews like antlers, buffalo horns and ostrich bones - just be sure to monitor chewing at all times. If your dog consistently chews non-food items like cardboard, it’s a good idea to talk to your veterinarian to rule out any underlying health issues.</p>
      <h2 id="Begging every time you eat">Begging every time you eat</h2>
      <p>Explanation: All dogs are interested in human food for the exact same reasons as us - smell and taste! Their olfactory receptors are, after all, a thousand times more sensitive than ours, so it’s no wonder they’re prone to salivating and staring at you with longing eyes every time you sit down to eat.</p>
      <p>However, food fixation is often an issue caused by us as owners by reinforcing the behaviour. If we offer our dog too many “human treats” or allow them to beg in the kitchen or at the dinner table and then reinforce this behaviour by giving them a piece of food, they learn that begging is a behaviour that gets them what they want, which can lead to bad habits. Your dog may also learn that begging for food is a behaviour that gets your attention.</p>
      <p>How to fix it: If you can’t resist the puppy-dog eyes, try establishing clear boundaries around feeding by creating separation, like sending them to their bed. If your dog is crate trained, this is also a good way to create boundaries around meal times. Training them to go to a designated spot during your meal times and rewarding this will eventually teach your pup that begging is not rewarded, but being in their designated spot is.</p>
      <p>Be sure to ignore all begging behaviour and not give in by feeding them scraps or human food while cooking or eating. Be consistent and patient with your training - eventually, your dog will learn to respect your space while you enjoy your meals!</p>
      <h2 id="Being lazy">Being lazy</h2>
      <p>When talking about laziness in relation to dogs, we first have to be sure that any low energy levels are not any underlying health or behavioural issues. If you notice a sudden change in your dog's energy or behaviour, always consult with a veterinarian first to rule out any health problems like obesity, arthritis or other chronic conditions.</p>
      <p>Explanation:  In healthy dogs, laziness can be down to a few different factors like breed, age, and even temperament. Just like humans, some dogs are naturally more laid-back than others. Breeds like Great Danes, Bulldogs and Basset Hounds are also known for being more laid-back and less active than other breeds, and for some dogs, as they age, you’ll find they like to spend more time resting.</p>
      <p>How to fix it: However, it’s important to ensure your dog isn’t becoming lazy due to lifestyle or environment. Dogs need exercise and mental stimulation - if they don’t get enough of this, they may become lazy and uninterested. Equally, dogs that are kept in smaller living spaces or don’t have access to outdoor spaces and activities may also become bored and, as a result, less active.</p>
      <p>If you think your dog is a little on the lazy side, be sure to keep up the exercise with walking, jogging and games of fetch. You can also adjust the environment, so if you walk in the same park throughout the week, try switching up the route on the weekend to allow your pup to explore new environments and keep them mentally stimulated and engaged. Mentally stimulating activities like puzzles, scatter feeding, obedience training and hiding treats will also help challenge their minds and keep them engaged.</p>

<p>Walking is a huge part of daily life with a dog, and making sure they have a comfortable and well fitting collar or harness is important to keeping them happy and healthy. But have you ever found yourself wondering if one is better than the other?</p>
      <p>Collars have been a staple among the dog accessory world for many many years, providing a simple and effective way of securing a lead to your dog while also signifying that they are not a stray and likely have an owner who loves them. But over the years more and more dogs can be found strutting the streets with their lead attached to a harness instead. So when it comes to clipping on your lead and heading out for a walk, which one is better?</p>
      <h2 id="Collar vs Harness. The pros and the cons">Collar vs Harness. The pros and the cons</h2>
      <p>The main difference between the two is simple: a collar fastens around the dog's neck, typically with a buckle or clasp, whereas a harness covers a wider surface area (the chest, shoulders, and upper back). Both can often be adjusted to ensure a secure and comfortable fit, and they can now be found in various different colours and styles to suit your aesthetic desires, so if like us you love to switch up your accessories, there are plenty of options to choose from.</p>
      <h3 id="Dog Collar">Dog Collar</h3>
      <h3 id="Pros">Pros</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Convenient, and less intrusive. Collars are lightweight, easy to take on and off, and comfortable enough to be left on at all times.</li>
        <li>D ring to hold ID tag. UK law requires all dogs to wear identification tags in public places, and the D ring of a dog collar is the perfect place for it to sit.</li>
        <li>Different styles to try. From the flat collars you may most commonly see, to the martingale collar seen on Whippets and Greyhounds, there are different styles of collars to suit different needs, and breeds. Making sure you have the correct fit for your dog's collar is a necessity no matter what style you have.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="Cons">Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Some dogs can easily slip out. If the collar is too loose, or your dog's head is a similar size to their neck, then you may find they’re more likely to slip out of a regular flat collar.</li>
        <li>Puts added pressure on a dogs trachea. The neck is a sensitive part for all dogs, so any form of pulling (whether that’s a quick tug of the lead or the consistent pulling of your pup) can cause damage to their neck, airway, spine and back. Because of this, it is not safe for dogs with certain medical conditions, such as glaucoma, eye proptosis, neck injuries or spinal malformations, to walk with a lead attached to their collar.</li>
        <li>Not safe for dogs that pull. Because of the above, it is not wise to walk your dog on a collar if they have a tendency to pull constantly and not walk by your side as this can cause injury and reduce airflow.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="Dog Harness">Dog Harness</h3>
      <h3 id="Pros">Pros</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduce pressure on neck and trachea. A harness distributes pressure over a larger surface of the dog's body (the chest, shoulders and upper back) as opposed to the neck, therefore reducing the risk of injury to this area. Linked with the above, a well-fitted harness can also help to reduce back pain in dogs.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Generally more secure. A harness fastens around the dog's body providing more security and safety, making it less likely for your dog to slip out.</li>
        <li>Available in a range of sizes and styles, from a step-in Y shape harness, to an over-the-head harness, an anti-pull harness, and many more. A harness with a front clip for your lead can be great if your dog is a heavy puller, as any tension on the lead when they pull causes them to turn back towards you and reduces their speed. This style can also give you more control over larger or stronger dogs, especially if it has both a front and back clip that can be used together with a double ended lead.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Great for puppies who haven’t learnt to walk on a lead yet.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="Cons">Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Less convenient. Unlike most collars, harnesses shouldn’t be left on all day, and they can be fiddly to put on and off. If you have an already nervous dog, they may take some time getting used to a harness, so it’s important to take it steady, opting for a step-in harness if they don’t like things being pulled over their heads.</li>
        <li>May not have space for an ID tag. If this is the case, it’s worth having a collar for your dog too so they are always wearing their ID tag.</li>
        <li>Can be uncomfortable. Most harnesses are bulkier than collars, so it can take time for your pup to get used to the feeling of wearing one if they’ve never worn one before.</li>
        <li>If your dog is not great at walking to heal, a back clip harness may actually train your dog to pull, which is probably the opposite of what you want.</li>
        <li>A badly fitted harness can be just as detrimental as a collar with too much pressure. Always ensure that their natural range of movement isn’t hindered (paying close attention to shoulders/extension of front legs) and make sure it is a comfortable and secure fit.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="Different types of harnesses and when to use them">Different types of harnesses and when to use them</h2>
      <h3 id="Back Clip Harnesses">Back Clip Harnesses</h3>
      <p>Best suited for dogs who already walk well on a lead, they’re possibly the most common style you’ll see, featuring a D-ring that sits along the centre line of the dog’s back. But if your dog isn’t the calmest when walking on a lead, this style may not be the right choice as it won’t discourage your dog from pulling (and may make pulling worse).</p>
      <h3 id="Front Clip Harnesses (or anti-pull harness)">Front Clip Harnesses (or anti-pull harness)</h3>
      <p>Opposite to the above, this style of harness allows you to clip the lead to a D-ring placed on the dog’s chest. They are great if your dog has a tendency to pull, as the front clip changes the point of leverage - when pulling occurs the tension on the lead draws the dog back towards you.</p>
      <h2>A harness with both front and back clip is known as a ‘<strong>dual clip harness</strong>’ - commonly slightly bulkier in fit so they may take a while to get used to, they’re a great training tool for dogs who pull and can provide you with slightly more control.</h2>
      <h3 id="Y-Shaped Harnesses">Y-Shaped Harnesses</h3>
      <p>The front of this style of harness looks like the letter Y, hence the name, and when fitted correctly it can provide greater freedom of shoulder movement for your dog while out and about. The ‘Y’ should sit on the dog's sternum - if it’s sitting too high it can damage the neck, just like a collar, but if it’s sitting too low it can interfere with their natural gait.</p>
      <h3 id="Step-in Harnesses">Step-in Harnesses</h3>
      <p>Perfect if your dog dislikes having things go over their head, and commonly paired with a Y shape and a back clip. Lay it flat on the ground and step your dog’s front paws into the two loops, then lift the straps up and fasten around your dog’s back.</p>
      <h2 id="Are there certain dog breeds that are better with one over the others?">Are there certain dog breeds that are better with one over the others?</h2>
      <h2>The short answer is, yes. There are some breeds where it is truly recommended to <strong>always opt for a harness over a collar</strong>, because walking on a collar can cause them severe pain or damage.</h2>
      <p>Brachycephalic breeds, and also Toy breeds, tend to have narrow airways so using a collar can really limit the amount of air that gets through if too much pressure is applied.</p>
      <p>These breeds include, but are not limited to;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bulldogs</li>
        <li>French Bulldogs</li>
        <li>Pugs</li>
        <li>Boston Terriers</li>
        <li>Boxers</li>
        <li>Chihuahuas</li>
        <li>Chinese Crested</li>
        <li>Italian Greyhounds</li>
        <li>Maltese</li>
        <li>Yorkshire Terriers</li>
        <li>Toy Poodles.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="How can using the right walking aid be beneficial to your dogs overall health?">How can using the right walking aid be beneficial to your dogs overall health?</h2>
      <p>If you’re anything like us, we’re pretty sure you are always going to want the best for your four-legged friend, so taking time to consider which walking aid is suited to them is important.</p>
      <p>By using the right one you can help to prevent any unnecessary injuries from happening and reduce any strain or pressure on sensitive areas, ensuring you are always prioritising the health and happiness of your pup and making walks enjoyable and safe for both of you. If you’re really unsure, or want a little more guidance then you can always speak to your vet to get a medical professionals opinion based on your dog’s overall health needs.</p>
      <h2 id="Does one help more with training compared to the other?">Does one help more with training compared to the other?</h2>
      <p>It can actually be really useful to familiarise your pup with a harness and a collar as they are both valuable tools when it comes to training. It’s important for them to wear a collar for identification purposes, but a harness can be a great starting point when training them to walk nicely on a lead due to the boundless amounts of energy they have (make sure you’re also armed with lots of tasty treats to keep their focus and reward the behaviours you want to see).</p>

<p>We hate to think about anything happening to our much-loved canine companions such as accidents, illness or our dog getting lost. Life happens however, and the unexpected can occur at any time - and when it does, it counts to have all protections in place to help cover the costs, give your dog the best care and make the situation as stress-free as possible.</p>
      <p>What exactly does pet insurance do, however? What does it include, and do we even need it at all?</p>
      <p>Read on for our guide to pet insurance for dogs and how having the right policy can give you, as a dog owner, peace and reassurance.</p>
      <h2 id="What is pet insurance for dogs?">What is pet insurance for dogs?</h2>
      <p>Insuring your pet simply means you pay a regular premium to a pet insurance provider so that if unexpected costs arise related to your dog, you’ll receive compensation.</p>
      <p>Having pet insurance for your dog means you’ll be helped to cover costs, for instance, if your dog dies, gets ill or injured and needs veterinary treatment. Depending on the terms of the cover, you could also receive financial help if your dog needs to stay in a kennel, have important surgery, or gets sick or hurt when overseas.</p>
      <h2 id="Types of pet insurance">Types of pet insurance</h2>
      <p>There are various types of pet insurance for dogs available, so you can choose the one most suited to your dog’s needs and/or your financial situation.</p>
      <b>Lifetime cover pet insurance</b>
      <p>The most common type of pet insurance will cover costs for the span of your dog’s lifetime, and is the most comprehensive form of pet insurance. You’ll usually pay yearly for each year of your pet’s life, and it may get more expensive as they get older.</p>
      <b>Non-lifetime cover pet insurance</b>
      <p>Sometimes called annual cover, you will pay out yearly on a rolling basis. Choosing this type usually costs less and you can shop around each year for the best deal - however the cover is generally less comprehensive and might not include the protection you need.</p>
      <b>Accident only pet insurance</b>
      <p>This is the most basic type of dog insurance, and only covers if your pet has an</p>
      <p>accident (for instance, if they’re hit by a car) but doesn’t cover treatment for illnesses or health issues.</p>
      <h2 id="What does dog insurance usually cover?">What does dog insurance usually cover?</h2>
      <p>Pet insurance for dogs covers all kinds of scenarios, and though you hopefully won’t need to use it for long stretches of time, it’s useful to have the security for when things can and do happen. As well as paying for veterinary treatment, most insurance policies cover the following:</p>
      <p>Death by accident or illness</p>
      <p>If your dog sadly passes away prematurely, perhaps by accident or an unexpected illness, you can get back the cost of what you paid for your dog.</p>
      <p>If your dog goes missing</p>
      <p>If your dog gets lost or goes missing for a certain period of time, some pet insurers contribute costs towards missing pet posters or reward money. For some policies, this extends to the theft of your dog.</p>
      <p>If you travel with your dog overseas</p>
      <p>Some pet insurance companies cover the costs of treatment should your dog get ill or harmed when on holiday or travelling overseas.</p>
      <p>Costs for kennels or dogs’ homes</p>
      <p>If you need to leave your dog in a kennel for a period of time, perhaps because you’re going into hospital, some insurers will help you pay for this.</p>
      <p>End of life costs</p>
      <p>It’s usually covered by insurance if your dog has come to the end of their life and a vet deems it kinder to put the dog to sleep than have them endure continual pain. Cremation or burial costs may not be covered, however.</p>
      <h2 id="What isn’t covered by dog insurance?">What isn’t covered by dog insurance?</h2>
      <p>There are also scenarios that a typical dog insurance policy does not usually cover, such as the following:</p>
      <p>Treatment for recurring illnesses.</p>
      <p>Whether you receive cover would depend on the illness or health condition, but many are not included in a standard insurance policy.</p>
      <p>Dental treatment.</p>
      <p>Dogs’ dental work is only covered by some providers, and it sometimes depends if the teeth are affected by illness.</p>
      <p>Complementary treatments.</p>
      <p>Treatments such as acupuncture, hydrotherapy, osteopathy (recommended by a vet) are usually not provided as standard.</p>
      <h2>However, be sure to shop around. There are some providers, such as <a title="Waggel pet insurance" href="https://www.waggel.co.uk/" target="_blank">Waggel</a>, that <strong>do</strong> provide cover for the above scenarios as part of their standard policy. They even cover dogs with some long-term illnesses including diabetes and cancer - something that can be hard to find in other pet insurance brands.</h2>
      <p>Other scenarios that usually aren’t covered by standard dog insurance policies include:</p>
      <li>Pregnancy/breeding</li>
      <b>The vet bills for a pregnant dog, or a dog used for breeding, aren’t usually covered.</b>
      <li>Third-party liability</li>
      <b>If your dog harms someone or damages property, the costs of legal fees are usually an add-on rather than included in standard policy.</b>
      <li>Routine or elective treatments</li>
      <b>Things such as grooming or cosmetic treatments, preventative measures or routine check-ups aren’t usually covered by insurance.</b>
      <li>Pre-existing conditions</li>
      <b>If a dog has a condition brought on by an accident, illness or injury before the policy begins, those costs won’t be covered. Check the terms of your chosen pet insurance provider to see exclusions and inclusions.</b>
      <p>However, it’s a great idea to read through policies and compare differing dog insurance providers as some will cover things that others don’t. Many Pets for example DO offer policies that cover pregnancy, third-party, and pre-existing conditions, so it’s always advised to do your research to find the best policy for you and your pup!</p>
      <p>When you’re choosing a pet insurance provider, read the full terms of the cover to check what’s included from top to bottom - this way you’ll find a policy of the most value to you and your pooch.</p>
      <h2 id="Why should you get pet insurance for dogs?">Why should you get pet insurance for dogs?</h2>
      <p>Keeping a pet can be costly, and insurance certainly adds to that bill - but the benefits of owning a lovable dog companion are endless, and (we think you’ll agree) far outweigh the expense. To make your decision easier, some providers offer extra perks alongside standard cover.</p>
      <p>With Waggel’s standard pet insurance policy, for instance, you’ll also receive added features such as free discounts and offers, a 24/7 video vet service, online behaviour consultations, the ability to make fully digital claims, and donations to a charity of your choosing.</p>
      <p>We know nothing can prevent the emotional distress of something happening to your dog - but it’s reassuring to know that if something unexpected happens, they will have access to the right health care and protection - and you will at least receive compensation to make the process easier.</p>
      <h2 id="Should you get insurance for your puppy?">Should you get insurance for your puppy?</h2>
      <p>When you bring your puppy home, the last thing on your mind might be insurance. But insurance shouldn’t be reserved just for older dogs, especially when pups are just as prone to illnesses and accidents!</p>
      <p>If you’re looking to get a puppy, or are bringing one home in the next few weeks, it’s smart to look into insurance as soon as possible. You never know what kind of mischief your new puppy could get into, and it’s always best to be prepared for the worst case scenario.</p>
      <p>Whether you're looking for insurance for your puppy or an older dog, the types of insurance and coverage we’ve already mentioned still apply.</p>
      <h2 id="What to consider before insuring your puppy">What to consider before insuring your puppy</h2>
      <p>For absolute peace of mind, you should think about insuring your puppy regardless. But there are a couple of points you should consider when choosing the type of cover that’s best for you, for instance;</p>
      <b>Insurance prices differ for different breeds. If you’re at the beginning stages of bringing a puppy into your life and you’re yet to choose a breed, you should also consider how your chosen breed will affect the overall costs of your insurance.</b>
      <p>Insurance costs differ between breeds and sizes, as each type of dog brings common health issues that their specific breed is typically known for. Bigger dogs, like Dobermans, Labradors and Golden Retrievers tend to be more prone to joint problems like arthritis and dysplasia, and this is something your insurer will take into account. The smaller the breed, the less you tend to pay.</p>
      <b>Your pup’s sex will also affect how much you pay. The sex of your pup will also be factored in when shopping around for insurance as male puppies tend to be more expensive to insure than female puppies.</b>
      <p>This is down to certain characteristics that male pups tend to have thanks to their high testosterone levels. It can make them more likely to be in situations, especially with other dogs, that make them prone to injuries and other issues. It’s also been found that female puppies and dogs have a quicker recovery time when it comes to injuries and diseases, so costs less to insure.</p>
      <b>Costs rise as your pup gets older. As your pup transitions into an adult, they become more susceptible to health problems - just as we do! This means, as you calculate how much your new family member is going to cost you, you should always take your first payment as a starting point, remembering that this cost will rise.</b>
      <h2 id="How to keep your puppy happy and healthy">How to keep your puppy happy and healthy</h2>
      <p>The best way to help keep your puppy’s insurance costs as low as possible in the beginning is to make sure you’re raising a happy and healthy pup! A few ways you can make sure your pup is in great shape include;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Regular check-ups. Your puppy’s first couple of months are crucial. They’re starting to explore the world, teething like mad, and their body is going through a lot of changes. That said, it’s important to keep an eye on your pup to catch any conditions, illnesses or potential accidents that could turn into something less treatable. In their first few months, be sure to stay in contact with your vet and attend regular health checks to make sure everything’s looking good. After that first initial health check, you’ll have all the information you’ll need for your insurance provider to get the best coverage possible.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Vaccinations and worming. Staying on top of vaccinations and worming is very important for your puppy. With them being at such an explorative age, who knows what they might pick up! Plus, puppies are extremely prone to worms, no matter how careful you are. Ensuring you stay up to date with their latest jabs and worming medications makes for a healthy pup.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Food & Diet.  Feeding your pup the right stuff can set them on track to becoming a fit and healthy adult dog! This includes feeding them puppy food that is going to get them the right nutrients and go easy on their sensitive tummies. This also goes for the adult food which they’ll eventually transition to. Certain meats, veggies and added nutrients are great for maintaining their digestive health, as well as their joints and coats.</li>

      <p>Let’s answer some further commonly asked questions about getting pet insurance cover for your dog…</p>
      <h3 id="Is dog insurance worth it?">Is dog insurance worth it?</h3>
      <p>Most dog owners see their pooch as a much-loved and valued member of their family, so though there’s a cost to getting your pet insured, we think it’s very much worth it for the peace of mind in keeping your dog safe and healthy.</p>
      <p>It could be even more worth it if you have an old dog, a dog with a specific health condition, a pedigree dog that may be of high value (therefore more likely to be stolen), or if your dog’s breed is predisposed to health issues.</p>
      <p>If you aren’t sure you can afford a big yearly pay-out, there are other ways of paying, such as monthly or quarterly, which might make it more economical for you.</p>
      <h3 id="Do you need pet insurance for a dog in the UK?">Do you need pet insurance for a dog in the UK?</h3>
      <p>No one is required to get pet insurance, and it’s not illegal if you don’t get it. As experts and enthusiasts in the health and wellbeing of dogs, we are big advocates of getting the right pet insurance. If you take the risk of paying out for your dog if and when they need it, it could end up costing you much more in the long run. If you can’t pay for vet treatment when the time comes, this could put your dog at significant risk.</p>
      <h3 id="Can I get pet insurance for an older dog?">Can I get pet insurance for an older dog?</h3>
      <p>Older dogs can be insured just like younger dogs can - but it can often cost a bit more, as they’re more likely to need ongoing veterinary care.</p>
      <h3 id="Should my puppy come with insurance?">Should my puppy come with insurance?</h3>
      <p>When getting your pup from a reputable breeder, they’ll often hand them over alongside a puppy pack which will contain all the necessary information about their health and previous treatments. However, it’s not a legal requirement for your puppy to be insured, so breeders aren’t expected to give you your puppy with coverage already set up. This can be set up by you when your pup comes home.</p>
      <h3 id="What age can you insure your puppy?">What age can you insure your puppy?</h3>
      <p>Most insurance providers will cover puppies between the ages of 6-8 weeks. It’s best to get insurance as soon as possible before any illnesses or conditions develop, and worsen as they grow. The sooner you’re covered, the easier it’ll be to swerve any curveballs thrown your way.</p>
      <h3 id="What breed is the cheapest to insure?">What breed is the cheapest to insure?</h3>
      <p>The size and breed of your chosen pup will determine your insurance cost. Generally speaking, larger breeds will end up costing you more than smaller breeds. So breeds that grow up to be on the smaller side, like Jack Russells, Yorkshire Terriers and Shih Tzu will cost you the least to insure.</p>

  content: `
<p>The holidays are coming, and as you get to work organising gifts, decorations and dinner plans, you probably won’t consider your dog’s relationship with your Christmas tree until they come fur to fir with each other in a potential daily stand-off. You may be asking yourself: do dogs like Christmas trees? Will a real Christmas tree poison your dog? Are even fake Christmas trees toxic to dogs?</p>
      <p>To get these arboreal concerns out of the way, read on for our advice on keeping your dog (and your tree!) completely safe over the festive season.</p>
      <h2 id="Can you have a real Christmas tree with a dog?">Can you have a real Christmas tree with a dog?</h2>
      <p>If you’re used to the magic of a real Christmas tree, it can be tough to even consider going without one, no matter how much you love your dog. Thankfully, most live trees used at Christmas such as fir, pine and spruce are non-toxic to dogs - but it’s their decorations, plant fertiliser and dropping needles that may cause problems for your pooch.</p>
      <h3 id="Decorations">Decorations</h3>
      <p>Many tree decorations can prove hazardous to a dog’s safety; whether it’s chocolate or popcorn baubles, fragile glass ornaments that could smash and leave sharp pieces, or natural garlands, such as holly or mistletoe, that are toxic if ingested.</p>
      <h3 id="Tree sap">Tree sap</h3>
      <p>Real trees tend to secrete sap and other liquids on their trunk and leaves, and that could be an irritant to your dog if they decide to have a taste.</p>
      <h3 id="Dropping needles">Dropping needles</h3>
      <p>Traditional Christmas trees tend to drop a lot of spiky needles that gather on the floor. If your dog ingests these, it could cause irritation to their mouth and stomach.</p>
      <h3 id="Fertiliser">Fertiliser</h3>
      <p>If you water your tree with fertiliser or plant food, there’s also the risk of your pooch drinking toxic water from a plant pot or plate that could make them ill.</p>
      <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The simple answer is <strong>yes</strong> - you can have a real Christmas tree, so long as you take necessary dog-proofing precautions (coming up).&nbsp;</span></h2>
      <h3 id="Can dogs eat Christmas trees?">Can dogs eat Christmas trees?</h3>
      <p>If your dog does munch on a branch of your glorious tree, it shouldn’t cause any life-threatening injury. The pine needles however are an irritant to a dog’s mouth and sensitive stomach and could cause gastrointestinal issues if eaten in large amounts. Even if he seems to find it appetising, it’s best to deter your dog from seeing the tree as a snack.</p>
      <h2 id="Are fake Christmas trees safe for dogs?">Are fake Christmas trees safe for dogs?</h2>
      <p>A fake tree solves the issue of falling pine needles, however if your dog is prone to chewing on foreign objects, the fact that your tree isn’t alive may not make much of a difference to whether they end up swallowing bits of it. If this is the case, it’s a good idea to follow the same precautions as you would a real tree (list coming up below) to ensure your pooch isn’t ingesting anything they’ll regret.</p>
      <h3 id="Is the fake snow on Christmas trees toxic to dogs?">Is the fake snow on Christmas trees toxic to dogs?</h3>
      <p>A lot of artificial trees come with a scenic dusting of fake snow - this isn’t so pleasant however if it finds its way into your dog’s stomach. Though the ingredients in fake snow vary, some is toxic to dogs and some isn’t - so to be safe, avoid ‘snow-covered’ artificial trees and stick to ones with bare branches.</p>
      <h2 id="How to dog-proof your Christmas tree">How to dog-proof your Christmas tree</h2>
      <p>Ensure your dog and your Christmas tree keep a harmonious relationship by following these easy steps…</p>
      <h3 id="Leave the tree bare for a few days">Leave the tree bare for a few days</h3>
      <p>When you first put up the tree, it’s likely your dog will find this a distracting novelty. Leave it bare without decoration for a few days - then hopefully, when you do get around to decorating it, your pooch will be bored of it already.</p>
      <h3 id="Avoid edible decorations">Avoid edible decorations</h3>
      <p>As mentioned, chocolate, biscuit or popcorn decorations will only tempt your dog to jump up and get a bite. Best to avoid edible decorations altogether.</p>
      <h3 id="Keep the tree behind a barricade">Keep the tree behind a barricade</h3>
      <p>If possible, place your tree out of reach - perhaps perched behind or on top of a piece of furniture, or tucked behind a Christmas tree guard for dogs.</p>
      <h3 id="Put delicate ornaments at the top">Put delicate ornaments at the top</h3>
      <p>Decorations that are easily broken should be placed high up to avoid a jumping or climbing canine.</p>
      <h3 id="Place poisonous live plants out of reach">Place poisonous live plants out of reach</h3>
      <p>Similarly, if you can’t have Christmas without holly or mistletoe, be sure they’re well above doggy height.</p>
      <h3 id="No open flames">No open flames</h3>
      <p>It seems an obvious point, but be sure that candles aren’t on or anywhere near your Christmas tree - a clumsy dog could spell disaster.</p>
      <h3 id="Hide electrical cords">Hide electrical cords</h3>
      <p>Dogs chew trees and they also chew leads - keep the cord of any Christmas lights out of sight to avoid fire hazards and darkness.</p>
      <h3 id="Keep presents somewhere else">Keep presents somewhere else</h3>
      <p>Wrapped presents beneath the tree look truly magical - but rather than build the pile in the lead-up, which will only attract your dog to the tree, perhaps keep them hidden until the day itself.</p>

<p>With Halloween just around the corner, planning outfits and stocking up on sweets for trick-or-treaters are not the only things you need to be planning ahead for. Halloween can be a particularly dangerous time for our furry friends, with many things posing a threat to their health and well-being. Not only this, but it could even pose a danger to those that find themselves at your door.</p>
      <p>Dr Linda Simon (veterinary surgeon) and Dr Emma Scales-Theobald, PhD (dog behaviourist) have shared six essential pieces of advice for keeping your dogs and trick-or-treaters safe this Halloween.</p>
      <h2 id="Ensure all sweets and chocolates are stored out of reach">Ensure all sweets and chocolates are stored out of reach</h2>
      <h2><br><strong>Dr Linda Simon</strong> says, “Keeping all sweets and chocolate out of your dogs reach is advised all year long, however with Halloween comes copious amounts of both, so making sure they are kept where your dog cannot get to them is incredibly important.”<br><br>“Chocolate is poisonous for dogs, as it contains theobromine and caffeine, which are two stimulants that dogs cannot efficiently metabolise, so ingesting even a small amount can make them quite unwell. Most sweets contain sugar, but some use a sweetener called Xylitol. This is a substance that can cause a potent release of insulin from your dog's pancreas, thus causing a dangerous drop in blood sugar and even liver failure.”<br><br>“It isn’t just the sweets themselves that are harmful to your pooch. The wrappers and packaging pose their own risks. Consumption of these can cause serious internal damage, such as blockages and other issues that could lead to your dog requiring surgery.”<br><br><strong>Dr Emma Scales-Theobald, PhD</strong> says, “One way to ensure your dog is not eating things that they shouldn’t is to teach them the ‘leave it’ command. Teaching your dog this simple command will ensure you can stop them from consuming anything dangerous.”<br><br>“This is a relatively simple command to teach. Start with their favourite edible treat in one hand like <a href="https://www.poochandmutt.co.uk/products/meaty-treats-taster-pack" target="_blank" title="Probiotic Meaty treats for dogs" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pooch &amp; Mutts Probiotic Meaty Treats</a> and a less exciting ‘leave it’ item in the other. Hold the hand with the boring item out, letting your dog get a good sniff and wait for them to move or look away from it. When they do, mark this with a ‘yes’ and reward them with the tasty treat from the other hand.”<br><br>“You should practice and repeat this until your dog is consistently looking away or moving away. Once they are, you can then start to add in the cue. Say “leave”, hold out the ‘leave it’ item, then as your pooch looks away, mark and reward. Over time your dog will start to look away as soon as they hear the cue, and you’ll be able to use this for anything you don’t want them getting into!”</h2>
      <h2 id="Supervise young children when they have access to sweets">Supervise young children when they have access to sweets</h2>
      <h2><strong><span style="font-weight: 500;"><strong>Dr Linda Simon</strong> says,</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"> “As I mentioned in the previous piece of advice, sweets and chocolates are not safe for your dogs to consume. Whilst we adults know the dangers, our children might not. I recommend supervising young children when they are undoubtedly rummaging through their stash and ensuring they are not falling victim to your dog’s best puppy dog eyes and sharing their Halloween haul.”</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 500;"><strong>Dr Emma Scales-Theobald, PhD</strong> says,</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"> “As important as supervising your children is, it is also well worth teaching them how to behave around dogs, to keep both them and your pet safe. This would be a great time to teach them of the dangers associated with dogs consuming sweets and chocolate as well as teaching them how to enforce the ‘leave it’ command with your dog.”</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br></span></strong></h2>
      <h2 id="Keep lit pumpkins where dogs cannot reach them">Keep lit pumpkins where dogs cannot reach them</h2>
      <h2><span><strong>Dr Linda Simon</strong> says,</span><span> “Whilst pumpkin is actually quite good for your dog, containing lots of nutrients and fibre, consuming it in large quantities can lead to vomiting, pain, and even intestinal blockage.”</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>“It’s also a common Halloween tradition to pop a tealight candle inside a carved pumpkin, something you absolutely want to keep away from your dog. Not only is it a burn risk, but ingesting candle wax is likely to upset your dog’s tummy. Whilst eating a candle is unlikely to cause serious harm, many candles include chemicals or essential oils that could be more harmful. I would advise sticking to natural/non-toxic tea lights for your pumpkins this Halloween, to avoid any potentially pricey vet trips.”</span><span><br></span></h2>
      <h2 id="Keep dogs away from the door">Keep dogs away from the door</h2>
      <span>Dr Emma Scales-Theobald, PhD says,</span>
      <span>“With Halloween comes an influx of visitors, most of whom are strangers to both you and your dog. Lots of activity at your door can be quite stress-inducing for even the calmest of dogs, but if you have a particularly reactive dog, you need to be sure to prepare ahead of time. Whilst I will always recommend proper training with a professional to correct any reactive behaviours in your dog, there are things you can do to keep your dog calm and safe on the 31st October.”</span>
      <span>“If you allow your dog to free roam, the constant knocking and opening of the door could trigger a reaction that could put both your dog and the trick or treaters at risk. T</span>
      <span>his could be the dog escaping or your dog jumping up at and hurting those at the door in the worst-case scenario."</span>
      <p>“I would recommend setting up a room where your dog feels safe with a cosy bed and lots of blankets for them to curl up in. You also want to distract your dog from the sounds of knocking and new voices, so try adding some background noise such as a TV or radio and avert their attention to something that will keep their mind busy, such as a stuffed kong full of treats or a particular tasty chew.”</p>
      <h2 id="Be cautious when it comes to dressing up your dog">Be cautious when it comes to dressing up your dog</h2>
      <h2><span><strong>Dr Emma Scales-Theobald, PhD</strong> says,</span><span> “Trying to get a costume on your dog can be quite stressful for both parties, especially your unsuspecting pooch! I suggest getting your dog used to the costume a couple of weeks before Halloween with some positive reinforcement. Start by getting the costume out, laying it on the floor and allowing your dog to get a good sniff, all whilst offering praise and rewarding calm behaviour with a </span><a href="https://www.poochandmutt.co.uk/collections/treats-for-dogs" target="_blank" title="Tasty treats for dogs" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>tasty treat</span></a><span>. This should build a positive association with the costume.”</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>“Over the days, you can build this up by gently putting small parts of the costume on your dog and again rewarding calm behaviour, slowly building this up until you can put the whole costume on your dog with no fuss. If, however, your dog seems too stressed throughout this process, then it is best you skip a Halloween outfit. Keeping your dog happy and stress-free is far more important than squeezing them into a costume for one night.”</span><span><br></span></h2>
      <h2><span style="font-weight: 500;"><strong>Dr Linda Simon</strong> says,</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"> “Putting your dog in a costume is fun and can make for some seriously cute photos, however, making sure it is safe is exceptionally important. Whatever costume you put your dog in should not limit its ability to move comfortably and freely, breathe or bark. If it limits any of these, then do not force your dog to wear it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 300;">“Another precaution to take is to thoroughly check the costume over for any pieces that can be chewed off and become choking hazards. It, of course, goes without saying that when your dog is in a costume, you should supervise them at all times to ensure their safety.”</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 300;">“Your dog should be happy to have their costume on for the short time it is on, so make sure to keep an eye on them to ensure at no point they are starting to show signs of distress, anxiousness or even being too hot!”</span></h2>
      <h2 id="Make sure all decorations are well secured and out of reach">Make sure all decorations are well secured and out of reach</h2>
      <h2><span><strong>Dr Linda Simon</strong> says,</span><span> “Halloween poses many risks for your dog, with decorations being one of the largest. Dogs are incredibly inquisitive, and they explore new things with their noses and mouths. If you are someone that likes to decorate their home at Halloween, you need to ensure that all decorations are placed out of reach of your dog and are well secured to avoid your dog getting hold of them.”</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>“In the event of your dog chewing and ingesting any of your Halloween decorations, you will need to contact your vet as soon as possible. Ingestion of items of this kind can cause a whole host of issues, such from upset stomachs to intestinal blockages, which can become fatal.”</span></h2>
      <p>All in all, once you bear the above in mind you can have an exceptionally enjoyable time with your dog this Halloween. You could even really get into the spooky season and treat them to some Pumpkin Spice Meaty Treats to let them know when they're doing a good job.</p>

  content: `
<p>As the Met Office released yet another storm warning for areas of the UK, pet owners might find themselves with worried or anxious dogs as the storms roll in. Not only is this stressful for the dogs, but also for their owners.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, you can keep your dog calm during a storm if you follow these top tips.</p>
      <h2 id="Tire them out before the storm begins">Tire them out before the storm begins</h2>
      <p>Getting your dog sleepy before the storm begins will help to get them into a calm state of mind before the storm begins. Keep an eye on the weather forecast to get an idea of when the storm is due to start and take your dog on a long interesting walk beforehand, have them socialise with other dogs and even practice some training. Both the mental and physical stimulation should tire them out enough to help them sleep through most of, if not all of the storm.</p>
      <h2 id="Lead by example and stay calm yourself">Lead by example and stay calm yourself</h2>
      <p>When the storm starts, be cautious not to act unsettled yourself. We often forget that dogs can quickly pick up on our body language and stress levels which may in turn upset them if they sense that you are anxious. Act calm and confident and try not to fuss with them too much as this can cause them to feel stressed.</p>
      <h2 id="Create a safe haven away from windows">Create a safe haven away from windows</h2>
      <h2><strong><span style="font-weight: 300;">Feeling safe is really important to dogs, especially in times of fear. Creating a safe haven for them will give them somewhere to retreat to, to feel safe and secure. This could be anywhere in your home, but ideally away from any windows where they are likely to hear the thunder more or see the lightning. Make up a cosy bed with a pillow, throws and blankets for them to snuggle into or even hide under.</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 300;">For more anxious dogs, this ‘safe haven’ might need to be a little closer to your bed so they have that extra added security of knowing you are close by.</span></strong></h2>
      <h2 id="Offer them a distraction">Offer them a distraction</h2>
      <h2><strong><span style="font-weight: 300;">Distraction is a great way to take your dog's mind off of the big scary storm outside and avert their focus to something more enjoyable. Offering your dog a nice <a href="https://www.poochandmutt.co.uk/products/high-protein-beef-jerky-for-dogs" target="_blank" title="Beef Jerky for dogs" rel="noopener noreferrer">chew</a> that will take them some time to get through, or a <a href="https://www.poochandmutt.co.uk/collections/meaty-treats" target="_blank" title="Meaty treats for dogs with added probiotics" rel="noopener noreferrer">treat</a> filled Kong will keep their attention away from the storm and help them to feel calmer as they settle down for the night.</span></strong></h2>
      <h2 id="Play some background sounds">Play some background sounds</h2>
      <h2><strong><span style="font-weight: 300;">Background sounds are another great way to distract your dog from the loud and sudden crashes of thunder. Whether it be the TV, radio or even playing a dog-friendly </span><a href="https://www.poochandmutt.co.uk/blogs/health/calming-music-for-dogs-relaxed-pooch-playlist" target="_blank" title="Calming playlist spotify playlist" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 300;">calming playlist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300;">, these sounds should mask or at least diminish the volume of the thunder, increasing their comfort and reducing their anxiety and stress levels.</span></strong></h2>
      <h2 id="Invest in some blackout blinds or curtains...">Invest in some blackout blinds or curtains...</h2>
      <h2><strong><span style="font-weight: 300;">Depending on the size of the storm, lightning can be really bright, often lighting up the whole room. These sudden and unexpected flashes of light can be just as scary and the loud bangs of thunder to your pooch. I would recommend investing in some blackout blinds or curtains in a bid to keep the lightning flashes out and your dog calm.</span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 300;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 300;">Not only are blackout blinds great for keeping the lightning out, but they will also help your dog to sleep better.

      <p>If investing in blackout blinds or curtains isn’t an option, another way to reduce the impact of the lightning flashes is to turn a side light on. Leaving a light on will make the flashes of lightning seem far less bright and obvious, which should hopefully ease your dog's stress levels.</p>

      <p>At Pooch and Mutt we know that nutrition can have a huge effect on your dogs mood. There's a wide range of different supplements that can help an anxious dog calm down, including Probiotics, Lavender Oil and Hemp Oil. You can read a full guide on calming dog supplements here.</p>

<p>Some owners believe that ‘a treat is a treat’ and our dogs will be grateful for any food reward they are given. The truth is, not every treat is created equal.</p>
      <p>We will get a much better response to our training methods if we use high value rewards when we really need our dog to pay attention and play ball. Dogs are more likely to get excited about these training sessions and results are often faster.</p>
      <h2>Now, if that isn’t a good motivation for adding high value treats to your toolbox, I don’t know what is! Pooch &amp; Mutt&nbsp;have just launched a high value <a title="High protein beef jerky for dogs" href="https://www.poochandmutt.co.uk/products/high-protein-beef-jerky-for-dogs" target="_blank"><strong>beef jerky treat</strong></a> option that we know your pet will love. They have been gently dried in low temperatures over 24 hours to lock in nutrients and taste.</h2>
      <h2 id="What is a high value dog treat?">What is a high value dog treat?</h2>
      <p>A high value reward is one your dog is sure to get excited about. If offered alongside other food options, they will choose the higher value option every time as it is what they prefer.</p>
      <p>Low value treats tend to have a weaker taste and less calories. These can include raw carrot, raw apple and pieces of your dog’s dried kibble.</p>
      <p>High value rewards are highly palatable and dogs enjoy the experience of eating them. They will be very keen to get their reward and will work hard for it.</p>
      <p>Examples of high value treats include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Chunks of meat like chicken or lamb</li>
        <li>Cubes of cheese</li>
        <li>Beef Jerky</li>
        <li>Hot dog or sausage</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="The difference between high and low value treats">The difference between high and low value treats</h2>
      <p>Some of the main differences between these two types of treats include:</p>
      <h3 id="Taste">Taste</h3>
      <p>Most importantly, a high value treat is one that your dog perceives to be extra tasty. They would rarely, if ever, turn this treat down as it is just so delectable. While a sense of taste is individual, dogs tend to enjoy meaty flavours. As our beef jerky treat is 90% meat from beef, the taste will be very pleasing to our canine companions.</p>
      <h3 id="Smell">Smell</h3>
      <p>While omnivores, dogs have an undeniable preference for meat. When a treat smells meaty and satisfying, they’ll show a strong preference for it vs something that is plant based. While jerky may not be as smelly as some wet foods or treats, it still has a strong odour that your dog will easily detect.</p>
      <h3 id="Texture">Texture</h3>
      <p>Again, the texture a dog enjoys will depend on the dog and what they like. For most, dry biscuits are acceptable but may not be their favourite. In comparison, soft or chewy treats are usually strongly favoured by certain dogs. The soft, leathery texture of beef jerky is a firm favourite of most eaters.</p>
      <h2 id="When you would use high value treats">When you would use high value treats</h2>
      <p>High Value treats are ideal for rewarding good behaviour so your dog understands when they’ve done a great job. Equally, they are the perfect training tool; something your dog is sure to work hard to earn. There is no denying a dog works harder and is more responsive when there is something on offer that they really want.</p>
      <p>A great example of when to use a high value treat is when teaching your dog a brand new command or trying to overcome a phobia or long term behavioural issue (such as separation anxiety). On occasions like this, high value treats are often critical for the success of the training program.</p>
      <p>Similarly, when we expect there to be lots of distraction, like when training recall outdoors, we need to use high value treats to keep our dog’s attention. If the reward is not something they are too fussed about, they may choose the scent of a rabbit over their treat.</p>
      <p>Beef Jerky is a high value treat that is perfect for both training and treating. Not only this, but it is easy to bring out of the house with you in your coat pocket.</p>
      <h2 id="When you would not use high value treats">When you would not use high value treats</h2>
      <p>Interestingly, a high value treat may not always be the best option. If we over-use them, they lose their ‘sparkle’ and no longer have such an impact.</p>
      <p>For routine day to day training, ‘lower’ value treats like Pooch & Mutt Meaty Treats are a better option. We should reserve treats like the beef jerky for trickier training sessions.</p>
      <h2 id="Why is Pooch and Mutts Beef Jerky a good high-value reward?">Why is Pooch and Mutts Beef Jerky a good high-value reward?</h2>
      <p>This premium gain-free high meat jerky contains all natural ingredients including beef and rosemary extract. Just because a treat is delicious, doesn’t mean it has to be packed with junk and fillers. High value treats can be delectable as well as healthy.</p>
      <p>With such a high protein content, these treats are ideal for muscle growth and repair. Not only this, but dogs are hard-wired to seek out and enjoy protein rich foods.</p>
      <p>This beef jerky is suitable for all dogs as long as they are over the age of 8 weeks.</p>

<h2 id="Where Are The Most Dog-Friendly Places in the UK?">Where Are The Most Dog-Friendly Places in the UK?</h2>
      <p>Summer is here, and, for dog owners, that means more adventures with our favourite four-legged friends! Whether you want to take your pooch for a nice long walk in the park, along the beach, or if you want to go all out and enjoy a staycation together, the UK is home to plenty of dog-friendly places to explore.</p>
      <p>Since 27% of UK adults own a dog, we took it upon ourselves, here at Pooch and Mutt, to find out where the most dog-friendly places are in the UK, including parks, restaurants, hotels and even where to go to take part in some unique activities together.</p>
      <p>To do this, we scraped the number of dog-friendly places on Bring Fido, by every city in the UK (76 cities) to determine the most popular regions as well as the best dog-friendly cities. We then scraped the number of listings on each page per metric within a 40km radius. Keep reading to discover the results and find out where you should be taking your dog this summer!</p>
      <h2 id="Top 10 Most Dog-Friendly Places in the UK?">Top 10 Most Dog-Friendly Places in the UK?</h2>
      <p>Coming out on top, the best dog-friendly region to be in the UK is the West Midlands! With a grand total of 368 dog-friendly hotels, restaurants, parks and other fun activities, there’s an abundance of places to keep both you and your dog occupied. The South West of England was a close second with a total of 351 dog-friendly places, while Scotland came in 3rd.</p>
      <p>Of course, when it came to the most dog-friendly cities, the City of London was the clear winner thanks to its wide variety of other activities. This was followed closely by St Albans in the East of England and Birmingham, all of which are fantastic places to take your dog out for the day.</p>
      <h2 id="Where are the Best Dog-Friendly Parks and Beaches?">Where are the Best Dog-Friendly Parks and Beaches?</h2>
      <p>If you’re wanting to take your dog to a beautiful park or beach this summer, then Truro, which is located in the heart of Cornwall, is the place to be. It’s no secret that Cornwall is home to some of the most stunning beaches in the world with golden sands and clear blue waters, and you’ll find that Truro has 52 dog-friendly beaches and parks to choose from. One of the top-rated dog-friendly beaches is Vault Beach in Saint Austell. This sheltered beach is surrounded by calm sea, ideal for a doggy paddle.</p>
      <p>Plymouth came second on our list with 8 dog-friendly parks and beaches, while London followed with 7 perfect parks for dogs. Edinburgh, Dunfermline, Chester, Liverpool and York all took the bottom spots on our list as they only have 2 dog-friendly parks and beaches.</p>
      <h2 id="Where are the Best Dog-Friendly Restaurants and Cafes">Where are the Best Dog-Friendly Restaurants and Cafes</h2>
      <p>We all deserve to be treated to an indulgent lunch every now and then, even our dogs! We guarantee nothing will make them happier than dining with you while getting bundles of attention from staff and other diners.</p>
      <p>Whether you’re meeting up with friends and want to bring your dog along or you want to enjoy brunch with your fluffy bestie, the City of London is the best place for dog-friendly restaurants and cafes, with a total of 75 to choose from. North London pub, The Lord Palmerston, is an amazingly dog-friendly, local gastro pub with fantastic food and a great range of real ales. Beautifully decorated, the wonderfully accommodating chef will always provide a treat for your dog, and water is always available.</p>
      <p>St Albans is also very accommodating, with 38 dog-friendly restaurants and cafes to treat your pooch to, while Edinburgh has 12 places you can happily dine with your dog. Take a trip to Love, Peace and Coffee, a dog-friendly coffeehouse in Edinburgh, to enjoy freshly brewed coffee, homemade pastries, and sandwiches, or for a meal your four-legged friend won’t forget, stop by The Caley Sample Room, a laid-back gastropub that serves up a variety of delicious grub including a menu just for pups! Your mutt can choose from options like dog beer, biscuits, and beef sticks.</p>
      <p>Also in St Albans and other locations in and around London is Megan’s, a small, independently-owned dog-friendly spot that feels like a home away from home. Not only do they serve delicious brunch, lunch, dinner and cocktails for humans, but they also have comfortable dog beds for your four-legged friends to relax in after a long walk and yummy Pooch & Mutt treats to enjoy!</p>
      <h2 id="Where are the Best Dog-Friendly Hotels for a UK Staycation?">Where are the Best Dog-Friendly Hotels for a UK Staycation?</h2>
      <p>There’s nothing quite like a staycation in the summer, from exploring a new city over a long weekend to relaxing in the great British countryside. And, rather than leaving your dog with a friend or family member while you’re away, why not choose a place with plenty of dog-friendly hotels and give your dogs a break from their busy lives too?</p>
      <p>According to the experts in dog-friendly travel and the UK’s only dog-first travel website, Paws & Stay, “anyone who has a pet knows how much a part of the family they are, so it’s only right that they should be able to enjoy our holidays with us. Many dog owners tell us how tricky it is to find reliable kennels or dog-sitters, so if they can take their pet on their staycations to a place that truly welcomes dogs and not just tolerates them, it’s a win-win situation.”</p>
      <p>The City of London is the top spot to take your dog on holiday, with 181 dog-friendly hotels. This is followed by St Albans, which offers 167 dog-friendly hotels and Birmingham, with 86 hotels for your dog to get comfortable in. In total, the West Midlands region had a huge 345 dog-friendly hotels, so you’ll definitely be spoilt for choice!</p>
      <p>“Totnes is another one of the most dog-friendly towns we have come across, with a lovely array of shops, restaurants and outdoor spaces that both dogs and humans love.” add the experts at Paws & Stay. “The open-air Totnes Market welcomes dogs, and their owners, to follow their noses through its bustling stalls. Places close to the beach are also eternally popular. What dog doesn’t love a good run around on the beach before a splash in the ocean? Places like Whitstable in Kent are very popular because of the close proximity to London in places like The Cook’s Cottage, which is just a short stroll to the beach</p>
      <h2 id="Where’s the Best Place for Unique Dog-Friendly Activities?">Where’s the Best Place for Unique Dog-Friendly Activities?</h2>
      <p>Sometimes, we want to do more than simply take our dogs for a walk in the park. Luckily, there are plenty of other fun activities to experience that will strengthen the bond between you and your dog. The City of London offers 17 unique dog-friendly activities such as paddle boarding, dog yoga and a pet-friendly skincare store, so you can really pamper your pooch.</p>
      <p>However, Scotland is the region with the highest amount of dog activities, with 19 in total. Here, wizarding fans can participate in a Harry Potter walking tour in Edinburgh with their dogs - capturing all the magical snaps for Instagram. Edinburgh also offers personal training sessions where you can get fit alongside your dog and pet-friendly jewellers, so you can shop together too. In Glasgow, you can visit The Candy Rooms, which is Scotland's first pet-friendly salon that includes treatments for both humans and dogs.</p>
      <p>It's safe to say that the UK loves dogs, and you’ll be hard-pressed to find a city or region that doesn’t cater for your canine friends. While London is the best city for the most dog-friendly amenities, the West Midlands and South West of England are the best regions for a dog-friendly day out.</p>

  content: `
<p>If you’re the owner of a lovable pooch, you’ll probably know whether they’ve been microchipped. This tiny microchip, about the size of a grain of rice, is usually inserted into the scruff of your dog’s neck when they’re a puppy, and contains important identification details so they can be returned to you should they ever get lost.</p>
      <p>However, there seems to be a widespread knowledge gap regarding microchipping - ranging from what’s expected of you as a pet owner, to the vast number of UK pet databases your lovely pet could be listed on.</p>
      <h2>As&nbsp;Monday 15th August&nbsp;is <strong>Check The Chip Day</strong>, we’re here to give you the lowdown on all things pet chipping. By the end of the article you’ll hopefully feel empowered with the right information to keep your pet’s microchip up to date - and to choose a first-rate pet database that does everything possible to keep your pet safe.</h2>
      <h3 id="What’s the deal with pet chipping in the UK?">What’s the deal with pet chipping in the UK?</h3>
      <p>Every pet in the UK needs to be chipped, from dogs, cats, horses, rabbits - even lizards and tortoises. Microchipping for dogs by the time they’re eight weeks old became compulsory in 2016, and the same law for cats comes in 2023. Chipping is usually done by a vet and takes seconds to do; in fact, if you picked up your pet from a breeder or rescue centre, they legally should have been chipped already.</p>
      <p>It’s also compulsory to keep your pet’s details up to date - you risk a hefty fine of £500 if you fail to do so. The thing is, plenty of pet owners aren’t aware of this; many don’t know where their pet’s information is even stored, and those that do are often shocked to find that most pet database providers charge steep admin fees for making changes.</p>
      <p>So right now, there are multiple blockers in the pet chipping industry that ultimately discourage missing pets from being found. There are a few key steps you can take to combat this and keep your pet safe.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Know where your pet’s data is stored</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Do you know who your pet is listed with? There are 17 pet databases in the UK alone that are registered by DEFRA, so that’s a lot of places to check if you aren’t sure - and even more confusing if you have a number of pets assigned to different databases!</p>
      <p>Being DEFRA registered means they have to maintain their records, answer requests at all times and back up their data daily, but even the ‘top’ UK pet database brands such as Petlog have received a bunch of negative press over the years - for everything from losing the data of millions of beloved pets, to charging a premium to pet owners for simply changing their details.</p>
      <p>According to research conducted by Tailster, 35% of pet owners have no idea who their pet is registered with. To find out, you can start by getting their chip checked.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>If you haven’t recently, check your chip!</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Is your dog or cat prancing around with a useless chip? Your pet’s details are as important as any other identification records in your life - so learn how to check your pet’s microchip to be sure their information is up to date.</p>
      <p>When your perfect pooch bounded onto the scene, you should have received a confirmation letter or email with their chip information and ID number. If you’ve misplaced this, don’t worry - you can check your pet’s chip by taking them to the vet for a quick scan.</p>
      <p>Once you have your pet’s 15 digit ID number and the adjoining database information, keep a copy safe, as you’ll then be able to check your pet’s details whenever you like using an online chip checker.</p>
      <p>All DEFRA compliant databases should have a chip checker on their site, so once you have your pet’s ID number, you only have to enter it into the homepage of a compliant database, such as Pet Database, to find out for certain where your pooch’s details are stored.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>When things change, keep your pet’s chip up to date</li>
      </ol>
      <p>It’s the law to keep your pet’s details up to date, and it’s in your own interests - you don’t want your missing dog being returned to the wrong house!</p>
      <p>Despite this, 22% of pet owners who have moved home admit they didn’t update their pet’s records when they did so. Combined with more than a third who said they didn’t know who their pet was registered with, that’s a lot of dated doggie details floating around in the ether.</p>
      <p>Moving house is full of overwhelming admin and documentation, but remember - your pet is changing addresses too. Inform your pet database whenever you move home, your phone number changes or if your pet passes away; your pet’s records should reflect their current situation, just like for any precious member of your family.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Choose a pet database that puts pet safety before profit</li>
      </ol>
      <p>As mentioned, most pet database providers charge pet owners steep admin fees to make simple but crucial changes to their details - this shouldn’t be the case!</p>
      <p>That’s why Pooch & Mutt are supporting PetDatabase.com, which offers a new, more helpful way of storing your pet’s chip details - one that doesn’t include the pesky fees charged by the ‘top dogs’ of the chipping industry.</p>
      <p>Unlike the standard in the UK right now, PetDatabase.com believes in putting pets and their owners before profit.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It’s 100% free to use - including when changing your pet’s details.</li>
        <li>It’s open to all pets, so you can store all your animals’ details in one place.</li>
        <li>It’s a DEFRA registered, safe and secure service that you can trust.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>With 12 million dogs and 12 million cats currently residing in the UK, we believe pet chipping can be done better, and it’s about time, too.

<p>We all love our pets and the joy they provide us is immeasurable. The best way we can show our pets that we care, is to take great care of them. This means being a responsible owner and prioritising their happiness, health and wellbeing.</p>
      <p>As much as your pooch may enjoy a heated and padded bed or a day trip to the doggy spa, they will benefit much more from the ‘boring’ things like routine veterinary care, consistent training and high-quality food, so here are our TOP 5 things that every dog owner should do. Can you tick all 5 boxes?</p>
      <h2>&nbsp;<strong>1.&nbsp;Don’t forget about those vaccines. </strong>Most owners know their puppies need a set of vaccines before they can go outside. However, it is not uncommon for owners to leave their older dogs unvaccinated, sometimes for years at a time. While not every vaccine needs to be administered annually, Leptospirosis (core) and Kennel Cough (non core) do. This yearly trip to the vet also provides a great opportunity for a full check over and weigh-in and allows you to discuss any health or behavioural issues with your vet.&nbsp;</h2>
      <p>Following your yearly trip to the vet for vaccinations and a thorough check-up, thinking about safeguarding your furry friend's health with comprehensive pet insurance is a must. Just like humans, pets can unexpectedly fall ill or have an accident, leading to expensive vet bills. Pet insurance offers peace of mind by covering a portion of these expenses, ensuring your beloved pooch receives the care they need without causing financial stress. With different coverage options available, including accident-only, illness, and comprehensive plans - pet insurance means you can tailor protection to suit your pet's needs, and your budget!</p>
      <h2><strong>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Microchips are a must. </strong>It is the law in the UK for all dogs to be microchipped, meaning they can be traced back to their owner at all times. This ensures you would be reunited with your dog if they were ever stolen or if they go missing. If unsure if your dog has a chip, ask your vet to scan them the next time you’re in. If your pet needs to be chipped, this can be done during a consult and costs from £10-25.</h2>
      <h2><strong><em>Top Tip: Don’t forget to update your microchip details if you move home or change your phone number.</em></strong></h2>
      <h2><strong>&nbsp;3.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Continue with your dog’s training, even beyond their puppy years. </strong>A happy dog is one who knows what is expected from them. Dogs truly thrive when they have a set routine and a predictable training programme. Try to involve the whole family and to establish that everyone is on the same page when it comes to ‘rules’. Importantly, always reward good behaviour with lots of verbal praise and some <a href="https://www.poochandmutt.co.uk/collections/treats-for-dogs" title="Dog treats" target="_blank">treats</a>. This is true even for senior dogs; it’s not just puppies who need to be shown appreciation.</h2>
      <h2><strong>4. Offer a high quality diet. </strong>While premium diets will cost more, if you can afford them, they are worth the investment. Not only will your dog appreciate the fresh flavours, there are health benefits too. Diets like Pooch &amp; Mutt use quality ingredients to support optimal health; ensuring a <a href="https://www.poochandmutt.co.uk/products/soft-shiny-dry-food-for-dogs" title="soft and shiny dry food for dogs" target="_blank">shiny coat</a>, better stool quality and a <a href="https://www.poochandmutt.co.uk/products/health-digestion-dry-food" title="health &amp; digestion dry food for dogs" target="_blank">settled gut</a>. Premium diets are generally supplemented with ingredients such as probiotics and joint supportive ingredients, keeping your dog in tip top shape.</h2>
      <h2><strong>&nbsp;5.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Be their advocate. </strong>Where you can, try to understand your dog’s needs and to ‘be their voice’. Some example of this would include:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Using a bright yellow collar and lead that say ‘Nervous Dog’ on them when out walking, so a fearful dog can enjoy their walk without lots of other dogs approaching them.</li>
        <li>Reading their body language and understanding they get stressed and worked up when the post man comes to the front door, so you know to have them playing a game of fetch in the backyard at that time each day.</li>
        <li>Recognising they feel nauseous in the car, so ensuring they only go in it when they need to and that they aren’t fed a heavy meal beforehand. For some, anti-nausea medicine may be required.</li>
        <li>Really, any act that acknowledges what our dogs are feeling and helps them live a smoother life.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While the five things discussed above may not seem ground-breaking, it is the little things that can make a big difference in the long run.</p>

<div>It’s the month of love, and for many of us, our true love is actually our four-legged furry friend. They provide us with unconditional love, are more loyal than many humans and you don’t have to share your chocolate with them… perfect!
  So, if you plan on spending Valentine’s Day with your dog, here’s 5 simple ways to show your dog how much you love them?
 1. Head to Megan’s restaurant for a doggy date night. With multiple locations across London its the best spot in the neighbourhood for delicious food and cosy atmosphere, plus we’ve partnered with this delightful dog friendly restaurant so each location is stocked with Pooch & Mutt treats, dog beds and water bowls, it’s the perfect place for an evening out with your dog.
 2. Coffee date? If you have a friend with a pooch, why not meet up for a coffee and let your dogs do some socialising. This will not only allow you to catch up with a friend but provide your dog with some extra play time with another pooch.
 3. Sofa snuggles. There’s nothing better than snuggling with your pooch, so cuddle up on the sofa, put a film on and relax together. With the world moving at 100 miles an hour, it’s nice to just switch off and spend some quality time with your dog.
 4. New tricks? Spend some time teaching your dog a new trick, not only will this provide mental stimulation but will also help to strengthen the bond between you and your dog.
 5. Chocolate is toxic to dogs, so while we may guzzle the bubbly and chow down on chocolate when February 14th rolls round, these aren’t indulgences that can be shared with our furry friend. Nevertheless, your four-legged valentine doesn’t have to miss out this year. The clever folks at Pooch & Mutt have created some limited edition dog-friendly Valentine’s treats that are not only delicious but also healthy.</div>
      <div>How to give these treats
  These fun, heart-shaped treats can be given just as you’d give any dog treat. This may be as a little ‘dessert’ after a meal or during your training sessions. They are the perfect shape to use inside food puzzles such as at the bottom of a layered Kong. Their tempting smell also makes them perfect for scent work; meaning we can scatter them in the garden for our dog to enjoy finding.
  The Heart-y Health Benefits
  As with all of the food at Pooch & Mutt, these treats are grain free and junk free. That means no artificial colours, flavourings or preservatives. They are brimming with natural ingredients and real, whole foods.
  The Vitamin C in these treats may be heart protective, with research indicating that this vitamin can lower the risk of coronary heart disease in humans and even improve blood flow.
  The Thyme can reduce oxidative stress and protect the heart. It may also help to prevent high blood pressure and lower heart rate.
  Even the Probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus) in these yummy treats can help to support heart health. Probiotics have a range of benefits and have been found to counter cholesterol production and keep blood pressure from rising.
  Collagen supplements are a vital ‘building block’ for our dog’s heart and arteries. On top of this, collagen promotes healthy, elastic skin and can even prevent joint disease.</div>
      <div>What your dog will think
  These Love-ly treats mays soon become one of your dog’s favourites. Made with lamb and chicken, they have a meaty taste and smell and may just prove irresistible to your pooch. As these treats are highly digestible, your dog’s gut will thank you too.
  So, why not show your dog you love them, by offering these healthy, tasty treats this Valentine’s day?</div>

<p>A dog walk is so much more than simply getting from point A to point B. It is a time where we can strengthen the bond with our dog, explore the great outdoors and get some fresh air and sunshine.</p>
      <p>Did you know, walking with your pet rather than by yourself has been scientifically proven to lower your stress levels? So, it won’t just be your dog benefitting from the interaction.</p>
      <h2 id="Avoiding Repetition">Avoiding Repetition</h2>
      <p>If you walk the same route day in and day out, both you and your dog are sure to get bored quickly. Variety is the spice of life when it comes to dog walks and you should be using them as an opportunity to explore your local area.</p>
      <p>Local greens, parks, beaches and hike routes are all there for you and your dog to enjoy together. If unsure where to start, most Local Facebook Groups will have suggestions, or you can ask the dog walkers you meet.</p>
      <h2 id="A Training Opportunity">A Training Opportunity</h2>
      <p>We can use walks as an opportunity to get in some training sessions. It can be harder for your dog to focus and pay attention to you when surrounded by outdoor distractions. You may find you need some high value treats, such as Pooch & Mutt’s Meaty Treats, to keep your dog focused.</p>
      <p>Depending on your aims, you may wish to work on recall, or perhaps some command training.  Remember that learning new things outside will usually take longer, especially for distractable breeds like Spaniels and Sighthounds.</p>
      <h2 id="Sniff sniff and sniff some more">Sniff sniff and sniff some more</h2>
      <p>Owners often tell me how frustrated they are when they want to go for a walk but all their dog does is sniff. While I appreciate the frustration, it is a wonderful thing when your dog is relaxed enough to sniff outside. They will be picking up on the complex aroma of plants, wildlife and all the dogs that have gone before them. This is a vital source of mental enrichment.</p>
      <p>We can encourage sniffing by scatter feeding with dry treats such as Pooch & Mutt’s Meaty Treats. Just be sure to scatter the treats in a safe area free from nettles, toxic plants, plastic or glass.</p>
      <h2 id="Relinquish Control">Relinquish Control</h2>
      <p>What would happen if you let your dog set the pace and choose the route? While we may not want to try doing this during your dog’s early morning walk before you have to get to work, it can be fun to let your dog control the walk when you have time to spare.</p>
      <p>Most dogs will happily accept it when we lead the way but it can be nice for them to choose the route now and then. While some dogs stay close to home and tend to circle back quickly, your dog may just surprise you with where they choose to go.</p>
      <h2 id="Savour the Moment">Savour the Moment</h2>
      <p>All too often we look upon dog walking as a chore that needs to get done. Certainly, when it’s wet and dark, it’s hard to believe differently. However, watching your dog trot along confidently with their tail wagging is a real sight to be savoured.</p>
      <p>You may have had a hectic Christmas or perhaps you’ve been working harder than usual. Take this time to unplug and take a break. Share your dog’s joy at being outdoors; giving them a pat and cuddle. Walk time is a great opportunity to build your connection further, as you both admire the nature around you.</p>

<div>It isn’t hard to get carried away when the nice weather arrives. In between planning the inevitable barbecue, layering the sunblock on the kids and putting out the garden furniture, our dogs can sometimes get overlooked. However, it is important that we pay close attention to our furry friends on those days that the sun is out in force.</div>
      <p>While most dogs will need our help, certain dogs are less able to cope in warm weather. This is true of puppies and elderly dogs, those who are unwell, long-furred breeds and those who are over-weight. Similarly, snub-nosed breeds such as Pugs and Shih Tzus are less tolerant of the heat.</p>
      <p>Here are our top tips for keeping your four-legged friend cool in summer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sticking to the shade. While it may seem obvious, it is important to make a conscious effort to keep your dog out of direct sunlight. Frustratingly, they don’t understand how important this is and many are sun worshippers. Place their blanket or a cooling mat in a shaded spot that is well ventilated.</li>
        <li>Timing your walks. The ideal time for a walk is early morning. This is before the ground has had time to warm up and when the air is still cool. The next best time is as the sun sets (though you’ll have a while to wait in the UK!). When very hot, use walks as an opportunity to toilet rather than a time to exercise.</li>
        <li>Don’t let Fido overdo it. If out and about with friends in the park, your dog may get over-excited and may be keen to play for an extended time. Try to keep them settled by bringing along some Calming Treats and offering them every now and then as a reward for your dog sticking close to you.</li>
        <li>Cool water is our friend. Paddling pools are a lovely treat to help dogs cool off. We can also freeze water and offer our pooches ice cubes throughout the day. Finally, if it is very hot, we can lay out some damp sheets (if a cooling mat is not available).</li>
        <li>Staying hydrated. Portable pet water bottles and collapsible water bowls are a wonderful invention that allow us to keep our dogs hydrated when on the go. At home, ensure the water bowl is always topped up with fresh water and consider adding a little water to each meal.</li>
        <li>Frozen food. No, we don’t mean you need to stock up the next time you’re in your local Iceland supermarket! You can freeze your dog’s regular Pooch and Mutt wet food inside a Kong or Lick Mat and watch their delight as they spend hours licking it just like an ice lolly. If you like, mix up flavours to pique their interest. You can also add a layer of e.g. peanut butter mixed with crumbled up Pooch & Mutt Meaty treats on top, if they’ve been extra good that day.</li>
        <li>Sun protection. For those who need it (notably lighter skinned and short-furred breeds), doggy sun cream is available for places like the face and ears. To protect the pads, keep your dog off surfaces like roads and pavements. Instead, stick to the grass when possible.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>One of the main risks during the summer is that your dog could develop Heat Stroke.</p>
      <p>Symptoms can come on quickly and usually include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Heavy panting</li>
        <li>Drooling</li>
        <li>Glazed eyes</li>
        <li>Red gums.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As signs progress, your dog may collapse and act confused. It is important you take them to your nearest vet right away. On your way, try to cool your dog down as much as possible. This means having the A/C in the car on high, placing a wet towel over them and offering drinking water. Heat stroke can be fatal and the sooner a dog is treated, the better their prognosis.</p>
      <p>With a little forward planning, your dog can enjoy the summer just as much as you. Be mindful of their needs and remember that they don’t always understand the dangers of warm weather.</p>

<div>We’re all dreaming of the day when we can hop in our car with our pooch and set off on a relaxing holiday. Perhaps we will hot tail it down to the coast to soak up the sun or head for the mountains to pitch up a tent and reconnect with nature. Wherever it is you and your dog are planning to do to recharge your batteries, read on for some useful advice on travelling together.
For most, the journey starts with a car ride. Not every dog is the perfect passenger and some suffer with anxiety and/or travel sickness when in a moving vehicle. 
You may notice your dog will bark, whine, drool, pant or vomit once the car is moving.
It can help to:
Get your pooch used to the car by taking small journeys frequently ahead of time
Avoid a heavy meal just before you set off
Keep the window slightly ajar to ensure a cooling breeze
Keep your pet restrained in a carrier or with a seat belt to prevent them moving about too much and to keep them secure
Spray calming pheromones on a blanket in the car
Consider playing calming classical music (yes, really!)
Take plenty of pit stops
In fact, pit stops can be key to ensuring a journey doesn’t become stressful. By providing lots of opportunities for your furry friend to stretch their legs and have a sniff around, we can prevent frustration. It is also a great idea to bring along a collapsible water bowl and small, digestible meals for them to snack on when out of the car. How long your dog can go between stops will depend on their breed and temperament, but the more stops the better.
Our Calm & Relaxed food and treats are ideal for long journeys and holidays and you may wish to start feeding them a few weeks before the trip, as well as for the duration of it. This can help your dog cope with the new environment and take the change in their stride. Remember though, make any food transitions gradually as you don’t want to be dealing with a dodgy stomach while travelling!
These treats are especially good for rewarding your dog for remaining settled when in the car and can help reinforce good behaviour while travelling. The cylindrical tube fits beautifully in most coffee cup holders and should fit plenty of treats for the ride. The chamomile and L Tryptophan contained should help to minimize stress and may even promote a restful nap.
Remember, if your dog does vomit, try not to get annoyed or punish them. Clean the mess up as quick as you can and reassure your travel companion that all is okay. Give them lots of love as they’re likely not feeling great. If possible, pull over and let them step outside for some fresh air.
TOP TIP: For the nauseous traveller, consider asking your vet for some prescription anti-nausea medicine. While many travel sick pups find things improve with age, this is not always the case for every dog.
Once on your holiday, remember that your dog may find the change in environment and routine tough to handle. They may show this by acting out of character; perhaps more quiet, clingy or hyper than usual. You might also find that they are restless and find it hard to settle. Things that will help them cope include:

Trying to stick to a similar routine to what they would be doing at home
Bringing along familiar bedding and toys
Giving them something to do to occupy their mind while inside, like a scenting game or long-lasting chew
Giving them plenty of fuss, attention and reassurance
Trying to include them in activities as much as possible so they aren't left alone for too long
Remember, holidays can be relaxing breaks for your pet too. With a little forward planning, they will hopefully enjoy the time away just as much as you!</div>

<p>As strange and stressful as Coronavirus was for us and our families, it must have been that little bit more peculiar for our pooches who haven’t the foggiest why we were around all day, cramping their style and limiting their time outside. For dogs who are already naturally nervous, the recent times might be that much harder for them to handle.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, there are plenty of things that we can try to keep our dogs entertained and content while we all adjust.</p>
      <h2 id="Keep dogs busy and well-exercised">Keep dogs busy and well-exercised</h2>
      <p>As is true for people, the busier a dog is, the less time they have to dwell on their worries and the fact that any routine has been changed. A dog’s exercise requirements (and capabilities) will depend on their age and breed, so be sure not to push your dog too far. Working breeds such as Spaniels, Retrievers and Collies will be delighted with a few hours of exercise every day, while lap dogs such as Shih Tzus may simply raise their eyebrow and sit down if you suggest anything more than their usual half hour! Make the most of your walks by exploring new and different routes and allowing your dog to sniff along the way. While many owners find it frustrating to stop at every weed and tree for a good ole sniff, this is actually one of the most exciting part of the walk for dogs, so try not to deprive them.</p>
      <p>Some breeds love to swim and will happily doggy paddle in the local lake or in a back garden paddling pool. Try not to let them consume too much of the water (avoid throwing them sticks and balls which can result in water ingestion) and be sure to dry them thoroughly after their swim. For those dogs with long and furry ears, it’s important to dry their ear canals with cotton wool to remove any moisture, otherwise, they will be prone to ear infections; not something we want to be dealing with during lockdown.</p>
      <p>Get inventive and set up a mini agility course outside for your pooch using equipment from around the home and garden such as sticks, cardboard boxes, traffic cones and chairs. Encourage them to jump, crawl, climb and weave. Why not have all the family members take it in turn, to see who can achieve the fastest time?</p>
      <p>A word of warning: For those longer-haired or snub-nosed breeds such as Pekingeses and Chow Chows, they are less capable of exercising in warm and humid weather and can be prone to developing heat stroke.  In the summer, they should be brought out closer to dawn and dusk and kept in the shade. Always have fresh water nearby and stop exercising if they seem out of breath.</p>
      <h2 id="Give them mental stimulation">Give them mental stimulation</h2>
      <p>Just like physical stimulation, our cunning canines really benefit from some mental stimulation to keep them happy and engaged. Without this, they can quickly become bored and may even resort to destructive tendencies such as chewing furniture and digging holes in the grass.</p>
      <p>A good place to start is with food puzzles. Start out simple and work your way up. A good first piece of ‘kit’ is a lick mat which can be spread with peanut butter (one which does not contain xylitol which is toxic to dogs), cottage cheese, natural yoghurt or sweet potato mash. To make it last longer, you can freeze it.</p>
      <p>The next level up would be a rubber ‘Kong’ toy which can be filled with layers of food. For the first layer, use something easy to reach with a doggy tongue such as Pooch & Mutt’s Meaty Treats. The next layer can be cooked pieces of chicken, turkey or white fish. On top, use something extra tasty to entice your dog in, such as some low-fat cream cheese. Experiment with different ingredients and, just like lick mats, Kongs can be frozen to last longer.</p>
      <p>Scenting games are fun for any dog and are a great way to burn off some steam. Why not hide some kibble and doggy treats around the garden? Sprinkle some about on the ground (these are the ‘easy’ finds to spark interest) and then also place some in ‘trickier’ places such as on benches or beside plant pots. Let your dog watch you place the treats while on a lead and then set him free and watch that tail wag! Of course, before you get started, do double check your back garden is free from any toxins such as lawn feed, weed killer or slug bait.</p>
      <h2 id="Manage their weight and diet">Manage their weight and diet</h2>
      <p>It’s all too easy to not notice a slow and subtle weight gain when we are around our dogs every day. Any reduction in exercise is going to mean a dog will put on weight unless we reduce their calorie intake. The best way to assess if our dog needs to lose weight is to assess their Body Condition Score and ensure they are within the normal range. The risk with allowing our dogs to get porky is that it can predispose them to medical conditions such as diabetes and cancer and can also negatively impact their mobility and worsen any pre-existing arthritis. Pooch & Mutt's ‘Slim & Slender’ is a vet recommended, premium, grain free, complete dry dog food for dogs that are overweight. This delicious kibble is made from lean free run chicken and is ideal if you are looking to manage your pooches lBS! Remember, if you are giving extra treats or chews to deduct the calorie allowance from their regular meals. As a rule of thumb, treats shouldn’t make up any more than 10% of your furry friend’s diet.</p>

      <p>While not every dog will require a calming food, they can be very beneficial for those prone to anxiety. With natural ingredients such as chamomile, l-trytophan and valerian root they encourage that ‘feel-good’ feeling and help provide a general sense of calm in these uncertain times.</p>
      <h2 id="Tips for going back to the office and leaving your dog at home">Tips for going back to the office and leaving your dog at home</h2>
      <p>You are not alone! We are faced with a situation we have not been in before and a great deal of young dogs have not received much socialisation due to the pandemic. They are also used to us being around 24/7 and it will be a shock to the system when normal life resumes.</p>
      <p>As much as you can, try to make the change gradual. This may mean spending some time alone (perhaps upstairs) without your dog. Similarly, go on some long walks without them if you can. Try not to make a big deal of these absences. We need them to understand that us leaving is normal and we will come back. When away, consider keeping them entertained with e.g. a Kong stuffed with Meaty Treats or a nice chew.</p>
      <p>When you do go back to the office, work hard to keep your pup’s routine as close to it was before as you can. Give them time and, hopefully, they will have settled into your new routine within a few weeks.</p>

<div>As any dog owner will know, our true soulmates in life seem to be our four-legged furry friends. They’re there when we wake up in the morning, always ready to provide a sloppy kiss, and never fail to put a smile on our faces.

This Valentine’s day, let’s have a look at the reasons why having a dog can be better than having a partner.</div>
      <div>1) They keep you active
Those daily walks with your pooch can boost serotonin levels in your brain keeping you happy and healthy. These daily walks are especially welcomed during lockdown giving us the perfect opportunity to get out of the house to enjoy nature and bond with our pooches.</div>
      <div>2) They’re happy to give you non-stop affection
Pooches love to show their affection all day long! Whether that’s a morning snuggle in bed or slobbery pup kisses throughout the day, they’re always there to show you some pooch love!</div>
      <div>3) They’re great listeners</div>
      <div>Dogs are always there to listen to our problems and make us feel better about pretty much everything! Best of all? They’ll never judge you when you tell them you’ve ruined your diet for the 3rd time this week!</div>
      <div>4) No one is as happy to see you as they are when you come home
After a long, tiring day at work, there is no greater joy than opening the door to our big bundles of love with their wagging tails waiting at the door. Guaranteed to put you in a good mood!</div>
      <div>5) They will never complain about having to watch “The Great British Bake Off” with you</div>
      <div>Pooches are happy to do as you please, as long as they can cuddle up next to you on the couch.</div>
      <div>6) They’re easy to shop for
Come Valentine's day, Birthdays and Christmases, they’re easy to shop for. Some of their favourite Pooch & Mutt treats and lots of fun toys will get those tails wagging!</div>
      <div>7) Everyone will love your dog
You’ll never have to worry about taking your pooch home to meet the parents, because, well…who doesn’t love dogs?</div>
      <div>8) As soon as your dog enters your life, you know you have a friend for life.
Our pooches give us unconditional love and bring so much happiness into our lives. What would we do without them?</div>

<p>One of the UK’s fastest growing and most-loved pet food brands, Pooch & Mutt, has taken a strategic investment from their long-time manufacturing partner the VAFO group, in a multi-million pound deal to help grow the brand and develop operations in the UK.</p>
      <p>The deal sees VAFO taking a minority share in the company with the ability to take more over time, whilst providing both the funding and manufacturing capabilities for the brand to grow. Pooch & Mutt’s founder, Guy Blaskey, remains at the helm of the London-based business, with the support of VAFO’s Petr Kriz, who joins the Pooch & Mutt board.</p>
      <p>This deal comes hot on the heels of a lot of other activity in the category such as Nestlé buying both tails.com and Lily’s Kitchen, 3i’s investment in MPM and L Catterton’s investment in Butternut Box, although Guy Blaskey is quick to point out the differences, “If you look at UK pet food sector you’ll see just 3 companies are responsible for about £60m losses in the last few years. That’s not sustainable. Inevitably these companies are going to have to make changes and we’ve already seen it in their product spec’s. I am building Pooch & Mutt as a brand for the long-term, one that is focussed on high-quality, innovation and doing what is right for the nation’s pets. Before this deal I have never taken any outside investment and the share structure was the same as on day 1. It has taken a long time to find the right deal and the right partner. With VAFO we now have access to the best manufacturing in Europe with the widest range of products produced by any pet food manufacturer. We are now part of a network of ambitious companies who share our values and make great products. Most importantly, unlike with many other investment deals, our goals are perfectly aligned, and perfectly aligned with our customers - we want to get more pets to eat great quality foods, treats and supplements to help them lead their best lives”.</p>
      <p>Pavel Bouska, CEO and the owner of VAFO Group comments, “I like to team up with people who share the same philosophy. The quality and sustainability of our products and its impact on the health of pets is at the centre of everything we do at VAFO. As we are predominantly producers, partnering with Guy Blaskey and Pooch & Mutt, who clearly share the same values and operate in the biggest pet food market in Europe, was only a natural step. Because we are a family company, our partnerships usually last for decades and not for years, as I am sure it will be in this case.”</p>
      <p>In recent years VAFO have invested heavily in their operations, opening their 8th plant in May 2020, as well as in M&A across Europe, investing in companies in Germany, Finland, Sweden, Poland and Estonia. This opens up huge opportunities both for Pooch & Mutt to expand internationally and to bring a large range of innovative, new products to the UK market.</p>
      <p>About Pooch & Mutt</p>
      <p>Pooch & Mutt is one of the UK’s fastest-growing, most award-winning premium pet food brands. Their focus is on natural, functional products, such as “Calm & Relaxed” and “Health & Digestion” that both do good and taste good.</p>
      <p>Pooch & Mutt launched as a dog health supplement company in 2007 then moved on to treats and foods with supplements ‘built-in’. The products are sold in Pets at Home, Sainsbury’s, Amazon, Ocado, Online Direct and via the best pet shops and vets.</p>
      <p>Pooch & Mutt has been awarded for their ethics, growth, packaging and innovation; winning more Grocer New Product Awards than any other pet food brand.</p>
      <p>About VAFO Group a.s.</p>
      <p>VAFO is a leading Czech producer of premium and super-premium pet food, snacks and supplements for dogs, cats, rodents, rabbits, fish and exotic animals. The company is considered to be one of the fastest-growing pet food producers globally. Its flagship brand Brit is distributed to more than 70 countries throughout four continents.</p>
      <p>VAFO operates eight production facilities for dry and wet pet food and also for various types of treats with the total production exceeding 100 thousand tons per year. The company is owned by Pavel Bouska, son of the original founder Frantisek. Pavel overtook the CEO role from his father in 2006. Expected sales of the whole group in 2020 are around EUR 260 million.</p>
      <p>Although little-known in the UK, VAFO has a larger turnover than the largest 3 pet food brands in the UK… combined! (Pedigree £86m, Butchers £68m, Harringtons £60m - Source Mintel 2019/20).</p>

<p>Now is the time to start preparing your dog for Fireworks. It may seem like a while away, but a bit of action now can save a lot of anguish later.</p>
      <p>Dogs are far more sensitive to sounds and vibrations than we are, so are understandably scared by fireworks. It is also very hard to get them to understand that we we are letting off small explosive devices to celebrate someone trying to blow up the Houses of Parliament in 1605, and that this is just for fun.</p>
      <p>Until we can get dogs to understand us a bit better the 5 tips below will help you and our pooch have the most enjoyable fireworks night that you can.</p>
      <p>A tired dog is a well-behaved dog</p>
      <p>This is true for most behavioural problems in dogs. Making sure that they are well exercised and tired will help with dogs becoming anxious and startled. Fireworks are now often let off as soon as it gets to dusk, so try to make sure that you get your dog exercised early enough to avoid the fireworks outside.</p>
      <p>Understand how the brain works</p>
      <p>Happiness and well-being are not just states of mind, they are chemical states, caused by neurotransmitters, like serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is derived from the amino acid L-Tryptophan, so if a dog does not have enough L-Tryptophan in their diet they will not produce serotonin and will find it hard to relax and be happy. L-Tryptophan is found in meats such as turkey and can be given in supplement form. Pooch & Mutt’s Calm & Relaxed dog food is 45% turkey and also contains supplemental L-Tryptophan. This should ideally be fed in the weeks leading up to situations like fireworks night.</p>
      <p>Acclimatisation and association</p>
      <p>Dogs brains work by association. If your dog is currently scared of fireworks that means that they have a bad association with them. To solve this you can try to create a positive association. To do this you will need a recording of fireworks noise. You can buy CDs and DVDs or look them up on youtube. Play the recording, starting off at a low volume and building up. When you do this play with your dog, give them their favourite toy, or favourite food and generally make this a pleasurable experience. If you do this enough they will develop a positive association with the fireworks. This takes time but is a great solution.</p>
      <p>Natural remedies</p>
      <p>There are some great natural remedies that will help to keep your dog calm and relaxed, such as chamomile and lavender. You can get supplements with these ingredients included, and you can even give dogs chamomile tea (obviously cold!!). The easiest way to give these ingredients is in specific dog products, such as Pooch & Mutt’s Calming Meaty Treats. We would recommend feeding both of these for at least a few days before the event.</p>
      <p>Be a good Pooch-Parent</p>
      <p>To your dog you are the world, and more importantly the pack leader. Spending time with your dog in stressful situations is the best way to de-stress them. If you know that your dog hates fireworks try to spend fireworks night in with them, and play with them. A scary situation is bad enough, a scary situation without the person that you look to for guidance and security is a hundred times worse.</p>

<p>We all know how exciting going on holiday is, but leaving your pooch behind can be tough. It can be hard to relax when you are worried about how your dog is getting on.</p>
      <p>We’d love to be able to always take our furry friends along, but sometimes we know this isn't possible. This can be due to anxious pups or hotels not allowing dogs.</p>
      <p>Here are some helpful tips to prepare for your vacation.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Choosing a carer</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Moving your pooch around can be unsettling for them. This is why vets agree that pets are happier at home when owners travel.  A trusted in-home sitter will allow your pets to stay in familiar surroundings and maintain their usual routine, so you can avoid the stresses and costs of kennels and boarding. For this, we would recommend Trusted Housesitters, who have thousands of in-home pet sitters around the world.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>What to prepare before the holiday</li>
      </ol>
      <p>To reduce separation anxiety, be sure to let the sitter know your pooches daily routine. By doing this, your pooch can stay happy at home with a new human friend who helps them maintain their much-loved routine.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Don't prolong the goodbye</li>
      </ol>
      <p>We all know how easily dogs can sense our moods - if we’re anxious and stressed about something, they will probably be feeling the same!</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Pooch & Mutt Calm and Relaxed Treats</li>
      </ol>
      <p>These Calming Meaty Treats by Pooch and Mutt are a natural, ethical, gluten-free treat with added Chamomile and L-tryptophan to help keep your dog calm and relaxed.</p>
      <p>These treats are perfect for separation anxiety.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Pooch & Mutt Calm and Relaxed Food</li>
      </ol>
      <p>'Calm & Relaxed’ is a vet recommended, premium, grain-free, complete dried dog food for dogs that tend to be anxious or excitable. The food is packed with active ingredients, including 45% lean, L-tryptophan rich turkey, sweet potato and b-vitamins as a digestion-aiding fibre, chamomile – the traditional relaxing aid, brewer’s yeast, and probiotics and prebiotics to help aid digestion, which can be a cause of stress.</p>

<p>Dog allergies affect lots of people; as many as 35% of UK pet owners suffer from allergies. If dog allergies have you reluctant to welcome a four-legged friend into your home, don’t let it put you off just yet! If you’re already lucky enough to have a pooch in your home but suffer from dog allergies, there are some ways to help.</p>
      <h3 id="What causes dog allergies?">What causes dog allergies?</h3>
      <p>Dander - a protein found in a pet’s urine, saliva and skin is usually the cause of dog allergies. Your dog will spread dander throughout the home just from chasing a toy or having a little ear scratch! Symptoms of dog allergies can vary, but may include some of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A runny or stuffy nose</li>
        <li>Sneezing</li>
        <li>Chest tightness, shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing</li>
        <li>Watery, red or itchy eyes</li>
        <li>Skin rash</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you’re suffering from these allergy symptoms, it may be worth taking an allergy test to confirm the cause – it might not be your pet.</p>
      <h3 id="Hypoallergenic dogs">Hypoallergenic dogs</h3>
      <h2>Some breeds of <strong>hypoallergenic dogs</strong> are better suited to those with dog allergies. This won’t rule out allergies entirely, as pet allergies are triggered by dander and not fur. but hypoallergenic dogs who don’t shed might spread less dander. Examples of hypoallergenic dogs include:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Shih Tzu</li>
        <li>Yorkshire Terrier (in fact, many types of terrier!)</li>
        <li>Bichon Frise</li>
        <li>Portuguese Water Dogs</li>
        <li>Poodle</li>
        <li>Miniature Schnauzer</li>
        <li>Maltese</li>
        <li>Lhasa Apso</li>
        <li>Havanese</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="How to help pet allergies">How to help pet allergies</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Keep your dog out of the bedroom. You might like a cuddle with your pooch in bed, but your allergies will thank you if you resist using your dog as a pillow. Keep your bedroom as a dog-free zone for better sleep.</li>
        <li>Clean carpets and upholstery regularly. Hoovering your home at least once a week can help to reduce the levels of dander in your home. Vacuums with a HEPA filter can suck up tiny bits of matter like dander that other vacuum cleaners might miss.</li>
        <li>Use a HEPA air purifier. Using a HEPA filter vacuum will help when it comes to cleaning your home, but pet dander gets everywhere! A HEPA air purifier can reduce allergens in the air; keep one in the area your pooch spends the most time to help reduce the symptoms of dog allergies.</li>
        <li>Bath your dog at least once a week. Bathing your pooch will help reduce airborne allergens. A trip to the groomers will help too!</li>
        <li>Use allergy medication. Antihistamine medication can soothe symptoms; this can be in tablet, nasal spray, or eye drop form depending on where your symptoms strike.</li>
      </ol>

<h2>Walks are a part of any dog owner’s daily routine. It’s important for your pooch to get <strong>regular exercise</strong> for their general well-being, but also because they love to be active!</h2>
      <p>Daily walks aside, sometimes it can be fun to try something different. Here are 3 fun activities to try with your dog.</p>
      <h3 id="1. Dog yoga">1. Dog yoga</h3>
      <h2><strong>Benefits:</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Dog Yoga gives you the chance to bond with your pooch, while also providing an opportunity for socialising with the dogs in your class.</li>
        <li>Yoga is a great way to practice focus and mindfulness; dog yoga can help alleviate stress and anxiety (in you and your pooch!).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Yes, you read it right. Dog yoga, or ‘Doga’, is still a relatively new concept, but the exercise can have health benefits for you and your pooch while being a fun bonding activity.</p>
      <p>If you’ve never tried yoga before but been interested, Dog Yoga could be a fun way to give it a go. While your pooch will probably be better at ‘downwards facing dog’ than you, generally, the class doesn’t use human yoga moves on dogs. They’re incorporated into human yoga positions, which involves focused, deep breathing and has a relaxing, soothing effect on your pooch’s central nervous system.</p>
      <h3 id="2. Dog swimming class">2. Dog swimming class</h3>
      <h2><strong>Benefits:</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Contribute to muscle strength & maintenance</li>
        <li>Increase the range of motion in the joints</li>
        <li>Improve circulation and cardiovascular fitness</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While Hydrotherapy is often used to aid post-surgery recovery, or dogs recovering from traumatic injury, it’s another fun way to exercise your dog with a range of health benefits. A dog swimming session can help improve muscle tone, cardiovascular stamina, and improve the range of movement in the joints. Swimming is gentle on the joints, so a great option for older dogs, or those with joint problems. If you’re concerned about your dog’s joints, adding Mobile Bones joint supplement to your dog’s diet can promote mobility and joint health, aid stiff joints/joint comfort and encourage bone strength. Mobile Bones has helped so many dogs enjoy an active life that the supplement comes with a 3-week money back guarantee if you don’t see a difference.</p>
      <h3 id="3. Agility training">3. Agility training</h3>
      <h2><strong>Benefits:</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Cardiovascular exercise</li>
        <li>Encourages obedience</li>
        <li>Fun!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Agility training is not just great exercise; it’s also helpful for behavioural training. If you’re new to agility training, you might want to find an agility club to get you started, but the great thing about agility training is you can do it from the comfort of your own home. Set up some fun activities in your garden, or inside if you have space. Alternatively, you can use household objects such as empty drawers, buckets, and pillows to set up your own obstacle course. If you’d rather buy the props, there are agility kits available online. Obstacle courses are not only fun for your pooch, but a great way to encourage their obedience. If you want to take the obstacle course to the next level, why not join in with your dog. Check out Battersea Dog & Cats Home’s Muddy Dog Challenge – the UK’s first obstacle course where you can compete with your dog. The challenge takes place on weekends, across multiple locations.</p>

<h2><strong>Easter bank holiday</strong> weekend is arguably the best of the year. Friday <em>and </em>Monday off work? Yes please!&nbsp;Whatever your bank holiday plans, there are plenty of easy options that can include your dog too.</h2>
      <h3 id="New Adventures">New Adventures</h3>
      <p>With the weather set to be sunny and warm this weekend, it’s a great time to get outside; be it a picnic in the park, strolling along the beach or hiking in new territory. Instead of your usual route, venture out on an extra-long walk or explore somewhere new. It’s a great way to introduce your dog to new sounds, sights and smells. The National Trust offers a variety of places perfect for dog walking. From coastal, countryside and urban areas, there’s a location for everyone.</p>
      <h3 id="Bank holiday baking">Bank holiday baking</h3>
      <h2>Fancy rolling up your sleeves with some baking this weekend? Why not whip up some <strong>homemade dog treats</strong> too, click <a href="https://www.poochandmutt.co.uk/blogs/nutrition/oats-sweet-potato-dog-treats">here</a> for a 3 ingredient healthy dog biscuit recipe. If you have a day of doggy activities planned, it’s a great idea to pack some treats to keep them going. Taking a toy to entertain your dog is also a good idea; Kong has a range of long-lasting, multipurpose toys that will keep your dog entertained for hours. You can fill your Kong with <a title="hypoallergenic treats and chews for dogs" href="https://www.poochandmutt.co.uk/collections/treats-for-dogs" target="_blank">dog treats</a> or for the ultimate treat challenge, you could try adding a dog-friendly human food. Natural low-fat yoghurt or peanut butter can be frozen inside a Kong, providing your pooch with hours of fun!</h2>
      <h3 id="Doggy Donation">Doggy Donation</h3>
      <p>Bank holiday is a great time to have a clear out at home. Consider rounding up your old dog blankets, beds, toys, and accessories and donating them to an animal shelter. Websites such as Support Adoption For Pets will often allow you to search for shelters in your area, so you can get in touch beforehand and find out what kind of donations they would appreciate.</p>
      <h3 id="New Tricks">New Tricks</h3>
      <p>Teaching your dog new tricks is fun and doesn't need to be done at home. If you're out in open space this weekend, it could be the perfect time to master "fetch"! If your dog is still getting to grips with basic commands such as “sit”, “lie down” and “paw”, you might want to focus on these before moving on to more advanced tricks. There are lots of helpful video tutorials online, ranging from basic to advanced tricks. Our MeatyTreats are great to help with training.</p>
      <h3 id="Pamper your pooch">Pamper your pooch</h3>
      <p>If you want to treat your dog but are looking for a less energetic way to spend the day, why not give your pooch a pamper. Choose a shampoo that conditions the coat and encourages the skin’s moisture - opt for one that's soap free. Some of the following ingredients are helpful and can be found in many natural products:</p>
      <h2><strong>Honey</strong>&nbsp;– naturally antibacterial<br> <strong>Vitamin E</strong>&nbsp;– prevents and repairs skin damage<br> <strong>Peppermint</strong>&nbsp;– naturally cooling and calming<br> <strong>Aloe Vera</strong>&nbsp;– naturally soothing and healing</h2>
      <p>However you choose to spend the long weekend, we hope you and your pooch have a lovely bank holiday!</p>

<h2 id="Why are cartons so much better than cans?">Why are cartons so much better than cans?</h2>
      <p>1. Raw materials</p>
      <p>Whilst it’s true that cans can be made from 20-100% recycled materials, this is very far from the full story. Metal, even if recycled is a non-renewable material - there is a finite amount of metal in the world and it has to be mined, melted and more, whereas cartons are predominantly made from card, that comes from trees. TetraPak uses trees from FSC forests. Not only are forests and infinite resource, when managed them properly and trees planted to replace the ones that used, the trees (especially the young saplings planted) actively help the planet by absorbing the CO2 from processes like can manufacture.</p>
      <p>2. Production</p>
      <p>It doesn’t take a lot of imagination to picture how a can is made. Imagine melting metal, forming sheets, bending metal sheets to can shapes etc etc. Just think how hard it would be (how much energy you would need to use) to change the shape of a metal can. By contrast, think about how easy it is to fold a carton. All the additional energy used comes at an environmental cost, normally the production and emissions of fossil fuels.</p>
      <p>3. Transportation of empty packaging</p>
      <p>When empty cans are transported, they are fully formed, and the majority of the space in the lorry is taken up by the air inside the empty cans. By contrast, empty cartons are transported flat, so the majority of the space in the lorry is taken up with the packaging, not air. This gives a 9:1 saving; Every lorry full of empty cartons is the equivalent of 9 lorries full of cans. Switching from feeding cans to cartons will mean fewer lorries on the roads, fewer emissions from those lorries, less traffic and even savings such as savings from engine and tyre wear and tear, which all add up.</p>
      <p>4. Storage and transportation of final product.</p>
      <p>As cans are round, they don’t fit together well, as cartons do. There is a lot of wasted air space between the cans. The space-saving switching from cans to cartons is around 40%. That’s 40% less space taken up in the lorries from the manufacturer, 40% less space taken up in warehouse storage, 40% less space taken up in distribution, 40% less space taken up in store or 40% less space taken up in the delivery service for online order, 40% less space taken up in the home.</p>
      <p>5. Weight</p>
      <p>An empty can weighs 127g compared to 41g for a carton. That is a huge weight saving across the life of the package. The very simple physics is that more weight means more energy to move it, and in this case, that energy will come predominantly from the fossil fuels powering the trucks carrying the products. By switching from can to cartons you are saving enough carbon emissions on weight alone to justify the choice.</p>
      <p>There is no argument that if you switch from cans to TetraPak you are going to have less of an environmental impact. There is definitely still a job to do to improve the rates of recycling, there is a perception that cartons are not widely recycled, but TetraPak has been doing a lot of work on this. The majority of UK councils offer TetraPak recycling, you can follow the link to find out about your local council at poochandmutt.com/tetra</p>
      <p>Pooch & Mutt launched their TetraPak cartons in May 2018 and figures to date show that customers purchasing the wet food cartons have saved the equivalent CO2 emissions of planting 100 trees this year. Based on these numbers, one dog enjoying Pooch & Mutt wet food cartons could help plant 13 trees over their average lifetime.</p>
      <p>No one thing is going to reverse, pause, or even slow down the damage that humans have done to the environment. We will solve these problems by everyone making a lot of small changes. Changing from cans to cartons is one of those small things that can have a proportionally big impact, and that should be part of the decision-making process of any environmentally aware dog owner.</p>

<p>The environment is the hot topic on everyone’s lips at the moment, and rightly so. For far too long big companies have put profits ahead of the planet and we are all becoming increasingly aware of how unsustainable this is.</p>
      <p>We need new approaches in a lot of industries to start fixing these issues and it tends to fall to smaller, more innovative, caring companies to develop these products and get them to market. These companies then need to promote these products. The new products and marketing are a threat to big, established companies, who have been resting on their laurels for far too long.</p>
      <span>These companies should be scared too. According to a recent report in The Grocer, the 3 biggest dog food brands (Pedigree, Bakers and Butchers) lost a combined £22.6m in sales in the last year.</span>
      <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><strong>Instead of trying to improve their products in any meaningful way the big brands resort to their standard, bullying ways of working.</strong> The latest case is the Pooch &amp; Mutt advert for their new cartons of wet food for dogs, which are 80% more environmentally friendly than cans - a fact backed up by studies by the packaging manufacturer TetraPak.</span></h2>
      <p>Pooch & Mutt has received threats to force them to remove the ad from the MPMA (Metal Packaging Manufacturers Association) presumably triggered by Big Pet Food Companies that dominate the market with canned dog food.</p>
      <p>Guy Blaskey, founder of Pooch & Mutt said, “This is not the first time we have received threats around our marketing. Last year we had to remove a page from our website informing people about the truth behind Baker’s ingredients, such as the fact that it contains crushed insects. We did not have to remove this because it is true. We had to remove it as Nestle used a loophole in the advertising laws to get the ASA to see what we saw as an informative piece of journalism, as a piece of comparative advertising.</p>
      <p>The latest campaign for our wet food cartons urges customers to ‘Ditch the Can. Help the Planet’, as cartons are proven to be 80% more environmentally friendly than cans. It’s disappointing to get threats from MPMA. This is probably the least controversial campaign that we have done. If I was running one of these companies and losing millions in sales year on year I’d spend more time getting my own house in order. It’s almost a compliment that they consider us such a threat”.</p>

  content: `
<p>The pet food market is a prime example of the hypocrisy of the large, multinational ‘Big Food’ companies.</p>
      <p>Yet another multinational, Mars, is trying to claw back some of the decreasing market shares of its brands like Pedigree with the launch of Nutro in the UK. Nutro claims to have a “commitment to clean”. They say that a pet’s food “energizes them from the inside out” and that the recipes are “simple, purposeful and trustworthy - made of real, recognizable non-GMO ingredients”.</p>
      <p>This stinks of hypocrisy. Nutro is not an independent company, it is a division of the confectionery company Mars. If the company, Mars, cared about ingredients being “real” and “recognisable”, then why not apply it to all pet products that they make? Mars is either ‘committed to clean’, or they are not.</p>
      <p>Mars do the same thing with their James Wellbeloved brand. James Wellbeloved says that their recipe for a healthy living means, “no wheat, no cheap bulking ingredients, no artificial preservatives, flavours or colours”. How does the Mars management live with themselves, knowing this, then formulating their primary brand, Pedigree, with wheat, cheap fillers and artificial ingredients?</p>
      <p>Mars isn’t alone in this. Nestlé’s Purina Beyond homepage questions “Do you really know what’s in your pet food”. Well, if you’re feeding their biggest brand, Purina Bakers the answer is a resounding “no” because they don’t make it clear on the label what is in the food. Purina Beyond claims to be selective about what goes in their food, “High-quality chicken, lamb or salmon as the #1 ingredient. No added wheat. No artificial colourants, flavouring or preservatives”. Then when you look at Purina Baker’s ingredients, cereals (including wheat) are the #1 ingredient making up over half of the food. Purina Bakers also seems to have dropped their “no artificial” claims - an investigation by Pooch and Mutt showed that Bakers did include artificial preservatives, such as BHT, but declared them as ‘antioxidants’ rather than ‘preservatives’. As the Nestlé Purina big chiefs seemingly know what is healthy for dogs, how can they purposely make one of their brands the complete opposite to this? Both Bakers and Beyond carry the Purina logo. How long is it until the public sees this logo as nothing more than corporate hypocrisy?</p>
      <p>This is not to say that large companies purchasing smaller companies are always a bad thing, and disingenuous on the side of the larger company. The purchase of Tails.com by Nestlé for a rumoured £120m+ / 10-15x sales is a great example of why a larger company should buy a smaller one. Innovation is stifled in large companies, and developing a direct to consumer brand would take an enormous amount of time. Much better to buy a company who has done all the hard work and roll that out across the world. That is a win for both Nestlé and Tails.</p>
      <p>Acquisitions of smaller brands by larger brands are nothing new. It’s rife at the moment; Heineken owns craft beers brands like Beavertown, Coca-cola owns Innocent and recently bought Costa Coffee, but in the pet world it’s different. When a consumer buys pet food they are buying for an animal who has limited abilities to communicate how the food makes them feel, so it is a greater responsibility. More importantly, pet food seems to be the only category where the marketing messages of the smaller brands are focussed on highlighting why the larger brands are bad for dogs. And at the same time, the larger brands like Pedigree and Bakers sell on their ‘health benefits’. The same company is saying that their main brands are both good for dogs, and bad for dogs at the same time.</p>
      <p>An even bigger hypocrisy is about to hit the pet market.</p>
      <p>One of the most important issues at the moment is the environment and the recyclability of packaging. Pet food pouches are notoriously difficult to recycle.</p>
      <p>The solution would be working with TerraCycle, a company who can recycle this difficult-to-recycle packaging. Pooch & Mutt, along with a few other pet food companies have been in discussions with Terracycle about launching a national recycling scheme for pouches. However, one ‘Big Pet Food’ company have swooped in with their deep pockets and signed a 2-year exclusivity deal to prohibit other companies working with TerraCycle and offering to recycle for their packaging.</p>
      <p>This is not a call out to Big Pet Food to stop their acquisitions or to not use companies like Terracycle to offer to recycle.</p>
      <p>This is a call out, to be honest, and be ethical.</p>
      <p>If these companies care about the environment, why prohibit other companies from using a recycling scheme? Why not work with all other manufacturers to create a national programme to help customers recycle all brands of pet food pouches, instead of just one?</p>
      <p>If these companies care about high-quality ingredients in food, why not apply it to all brands?</p>
      <p>The internet has given customers transparency to business. Customers want the brands they buy from to behave honestly and ethically. It’s time for Big Pet Food to start learning from the small brands that they are buying and to apply those learnings to their existing brands.</p>

<p>We have holidays dedicated to everything from National Tea Day to Black Friday, so it’s only right we celebrate mother earth as well! Earth Day is an annual event to celebrate the planet and to encourage people to help protect the environment. Not only is Earth Day a great time to consciously do something a little greener, but to also involve your dog in a fun way.  Looking for easy ways to celebrate Earth Day as a dog owner? We’ve got you covered.</p>
      <h2><span style="color: #274e13;"><strong>1. Go outside</strong></span></h2>
      <p>This seems like an obvious one, but instead of taking your dog on its usual route, treat them to a long walk in one of the UK’s many woods and parks. Going for a longer-than-usual walk is a great time to breathe deeply, really enjoy springtime, and fully appreciate nature. Find your nearest Woodland Trust wood here.</p>
      <h2><strong><span style="color: #274e13;">2. Recycle</span></strong></h2>
      <h2><span>As a dog owner, there are several ways to recycle a little bit more. It’s more ecologically friendly to buy bigger packages of dog food, therefore reducing packaging waste. Another great way to get your green on? Donate gently used dog toys to your nearest dog shelter or charity. Not only are you recycling, but you’re spreading the earth-day happiness!<br><br><img loading="lazy" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1415/0728/files/earthday2_large.jpg?v=1492784790"><br></span><span><strong><span style="color: #274e13;">3. Have a Dog Party</span></strong></span></h2>
      <h2>Commune with mother earth and invite your fellow dog-owning friends to the park. Make it a party, let the dogs run wild, and simply enjoy togetherness outside. Appreciate the fresh air and all the natural goodness Mother Nature has to offer. Don’t forget to clean up after yourselves though!<br><br><span style="color: #274e13;"><img loading="lazy" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1415/0728/files/earthday5_large.jpg?v=1492785444"><strong></strong></span></h2>
      <h2><span style="color: #274e13;"><strong>4. Buy Green</strong></span></h2>
      <p>Do a little research to find and purchase natural and sustainably-sourced food. Our dog food range has not only won Good Shopping Guide Ethical Brand award, but we make sure our ingredients are all-natural and healthy. Our Health & Digestion dog food is formulated with sustainably-sourced Scottish salmon.</p>
      <p>There are so many small things that we can not only do on Earth day to help protect our environment, but also little tasks we can incorporate into our every day lives.</p>

<p>With Channel 5 releasing a documentary about pet food at the end of January, their PR machine seems to have gone in to overdrive with every man and their dog (excuse the pun) weighing in to the debate. Unfortunately, most of the people involved in the debate seem to either have a commercial agenda of their own, or be chosen for their looks more than their expertise.</p>
      <p>The truth about pet food is that there is no truth. There is no one-size fits all diet that will be right for every dog, just as there is no one-size fits all diet that will work for every human.</p>
      <p>The only truth is that the diet that is right for your dog is the diet that they do best on and which is the best that you can afford. If your dog has bright eyes, a wet nose, a high quality coat, solid stools and you can feel their ribs with just a small covering of fat then what you are feeding them is right. It doesn’t matter whether it’s prime rib or polystyrene, if your dog is healthy that is what matters most (although obviously dogs would most likely not meet the healthy criteria on a polystyrene diet, and you certainly should not try it!).</p>
      <p>To make sense of the arguments I thought it was worth looking at what a few people are saying, and the people saying it:</p>
      <p>Who are the ‘experts’Bold Support</p>
      <p>As there is no 100% right and 100% wrong when it comes to feeding your dog, other than whatever makes your dog the healthiest that it can be, it is difficult to find unbiased ‘experts’. An ‘expert’ at a raw feeding company will have a different opinion to an ‘expert’ at mass-produced commercial dog food. These people are certainly knowledgeable and they should be listened to, but what they say should be taken with a pinch of salt and their views should be balanced against each other. They are very well informed opinions, but they are still just opinions.</p>
      <p>However there are many unqualified people who have weighed in to this debate. I don’t want to name names, but the channel 5 PR machine seem to have selected someone as the focus of their campaign, who may be good looking, and may have links to celebrities, but who in my opinion is not qualified to talk about nutrition. The reason that I say this is that she is quoted as saying, “'If you feed a dog a food made from sugar, salt, meat derivitives and ash, it's similar to you eating a highly processed ready meal. Not great”. At first glance what she is saying makes sense, but if you know how to read the label on a dog food bag you will know that ‘ash’ is not an ingredient in dog food. 'Ash' is one of the most commonly misunderstood terms in pet food. Contrary to the images it conjures, ash is simply a measure of the mineral content of a food. When calculating the food's calorific content, it is incinerated and the energy released is measured. All of the carbohydrate, fat and protein burn off leaving only the minerals. This is known as the ash content.</p>
      <p>Simply put, someone who does not know what ash refers to on a label is not an ‘expert’, and although their opinions may well be worth consideration, they should not, in my opinion, form the main PR drive for this debate.</p>
      <p>There are other articles, by other ‘experts’ that state that dogs should not be fed anything that is not ‘human grade’ and that they should eat the ‘wolf diet’ where they get a third of their nutrition from the bones. One of the main ingredients in dog foods that is not ‘human grade’ is ‘meat meal’. Meat meal gets a bad rep in some corners of the internet. One of the main problems is that there are different grades of meat meal and it is difficult to tell if they are high quality or not. A general rule is that if something is listed as ‘meat meal’ it can be bad, but if the animal is listed (i.e. ‘chicken meal’ or ‘lamb meal’) then this is likely to be higher quality and, in fact, more nutritious, that fresh meat. The irony here is that one of the main ingredients in meal that makes meal ‘not suitable for human consumption’ is bone, yet in the same article the same person is arguing that we should not feed our dogs ingredients that are ‘not fit for human consumption’ and that we should feed them bone – as bone is inherently not fit for human consumption (dogs digest bone very well… we don’t!). To me the value of an ‘expert’s’ opinion is diminished when they effectively do not agree with their own arguments.</p>
      <p>Scavengers Vs Wolves</p>
      <p>The 2 sides of the battle seem to have laid out their stall like this:</p>
      <p>The scavenger argument: Dogs are scavengers; you don’t have to be that precious about what they eat.</p>
      <p>The wolf argument; Dogs’ digestive systems are the same as wolves, so they should eat what wolves eat.</p>
      <p>Having said that there is no right or wrong, I cannot say that either of these arguments are wrong, but they are certainly flawed.</p>
      <p>The scavenger argument. Yes, dogs are naturally scavengers. Historically they developed close relationships with humans by scavenging from early settlements, probably about 10-15,000 years ago (or possibly up to 30,00 years ago. The first problem with this argument is that the foods that they scavenged remained unchanged until the industrial revolution. They will have scavenged discarded bones, meat, fat, veg, fruits etc – Ironically this is the diet that the ‘wolf argument’ says is right for dogs. Secondly, you only have to take a look at dogs in countries like Sri Lanka who do survive by scavenging to see how unhealthy they are. Dogs living on the streets in these countries tend not to look healthy, they look thin with dull coats – on this basis alone the scavenger argument is flawed.</p>
      <p>The wolf argument is the other extreme. Whilst the raw feeding/ wolf argument is arguably a healthier diet for a dog that scavenging modern foods, it is still flawed. A pet dog’s digestive system may well perfectly match a wild wolf’s, but that does not mean that their nutritional requirements are the same. Pet dogs have taken the myriad shapes that they have, from Chihuahuas to Great Danes, though human intervention via selective breeding over thousands of years. Breeds have been developed for specific purposes from companionship, to hunting, to retrieving. A Pomeranian has a fluffy coat, will spend most of it’s time in a house, do relatively little exercise and be fed twice a day, probably at exactly the same time. A wild wolf is about 5 times the size of a Pomeranian, lives outdoors, has a coarser coat, is very active, has to hunt for its food – so doesn’t have regular meal patterns. Arguing that a Pomeranian and a wild wolf have the same nutritional requirements is like arguing that Mo Farrah, running over 100 miles per week training for the Olympics, has the same nutritional requirements as the average person who spends 8 hours a day sitting at a desk. This is obviously flawed… and if you add into the argument the fact that double-Olympic-gold-medallist Mo Farrah is a vegetarian this confuses the argument even further! Secondly most of the people who buy (or sell) the wolf argument don’t take into account that one of the first things a wild wolf will eat when making a kill is it’s prey’s stomach and the stomach’s contents. Most of the ‘wolf’ diets that I have seen try to match the nutritional content of the prey itself, such as deer or rabbit, but do not account for the contents of the stomach, thereby leaving a lot of nutrients out of the diet.</p>
      <p>Meat derivatives and the horsemeat scandal</p>
      <p>Meat derivatives are, I expect, going to be one of the main villains of the Channel 5 documentary. I personally would not feed my dog food that listed it’s ingredients as meat derivatives, but meat derivatives are not necessarily bad: According to European law, 'meat and animal derivatives' is defined as "All the fleshy parts of slaughtered warm-blooded land animals, fresh or preserved by appropriate treatment, and all products and derivatives of the processing of the carcase or parts of the carcase of warm-blooded land animals".</p>
      <p>This means that if you make your dog food from sirloin steak you can list it on the ingredients as ‘meat derivatives and animal’… you would be stupid to, but you can. From a nutritional point of view meat derivatives may not be bad, they may not be good either. The truth is that we just don’t know, because the meat derivative description is so wide ranging. The reason that I suspect that most commercial dog foods list meat derivatives is so that they can change the exact meat content depending on price fluctuations of ingredients, without having to change their packaging. I think that it is underhand to sell a food as a “chicken” dog food and only include 4% chicken in the meat derivatives. This seems deceptive, but is not necessarily nutritionally bad. In my view it is similar to the horsemeat scandal; It is absolutely deplorable that Findus lasagnes were made with horsemeat, when they were sold as beef, but from a nutritional stand point horsemeat isn’t bad for you, all the other preservatives and ingredients that make it possible to sell a lasagne for £1 are probably worse.</p>
      <p>What’s in and what isn’t in</p>
      <p>What goes in to dog food is clearly a subject of huge debate, and as I say, there is not absolute right or wrong. As with humans we should be aware of things that are added to food that don’t need to be there; added salt and sugar which are nutritionally unnecessary, added artificial colours which are only there to appeal to humans (dogs do not see colours like we do) and artificial preservatives which just give a longer shelf life to give manufacturers economies of scale. From my point of view and the point of view of my company, Pooch & Mutt, the problem is as much what doesn’t go in, as what does. Many foods claim to be ‘nutritionally balanced’, but when every dog is different not only in terms of their genetic make-up, but also in terms of their activity levels, their domestic situation and any underlying conditions (such as arthritis or colitis) no one food can fit all. That is why people turn to products like our supplements (Bionic Biotic and Mobile Bones). These give dog owners the ability to ‘top up’ the nutritional qualities of their off-the-shelf food and tailor them to their dog’s specific situation.</p>
      <p>Pooch & Mutt’s simple goal is to help dogs lead happy, healthy lives. Undoubtedly there are lots of well-meaning people out there trying to do the same thing, but many do so by pedalling information (potentially mis-information) that they have learnt from specific sources. Many of these sources have commercial, rather than dogs’, interests at heart. People feel that they are doing ‘the right thing’ by pushing this information without questioning it.</p>
      <p>I have not written this article to get across the point that all commercial pet food is bad, nor have I written it to defend the petfood industry. I would not call myself an expert, I am someone involved in the petfood industry, who works with experts and I am someone who has enough knowledge to see through the spurious arguments of people who call themselves experts.</p>
      <p>My goal is not to put forward one argument or another. It is simply to try and put forward some balance and to get people to question the expertise of the so-called ‘experts’. Seemingly everyone involved in the TV debate is extremely at one end, or at the other. If there is a truth it is to be found somewhere in the middle.</p>
      <p>As I said at the start of this article, the right food for your dog is the one that makes your dog the healthiest that it can be… the truth is that simple.</p>
